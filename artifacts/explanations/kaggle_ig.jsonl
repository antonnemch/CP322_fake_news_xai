{"sample_id": 0, "text": "no sign of end to fight on u.s. ambassador to mexico, rubio holds firm. washington reuters republican presidential hopeful marco rubio has no plans to allow a vote on president barack obamas nominee to be ambassador to mexico, a spokesman said on thursday, despite calls from his fellow republicans and democrats in the senate to let her confirmation move ahead. the long delay in confirming career diplomat roberta jacobson has contributed to concerns about the state of u.s.mexico relations fueled by aggressive rhetoric against its citizens in the race to be the 2016 republican nominee. three democratic and one republican u.s. senator held a news conference on thursday calling for her nomination to move ahead. there has been no u.s. ambassador in mexico city for nine months. donald trump, the frontrunner for the republican nomination, has labeled mexicans drug runners and rapists and called for a massive wall along the border. rubio and fellow republican senator ted cruz have also proposed building a wall. obama nominated jacobson in june. she has faced resistance from rubio and some other lawmakers, however, for reasons including her role in helping negotiate obamas easing of relations with communistruled cuba and what they say is the administrations failure to prioritize human rights. rubio, a cubanamerican from florida, has been a leading opponent of the policy, saying havana should improve its rights record before trade and travel restrictions are eased. the senate foreign relations committee approved jacobsons nomination in november, with republican and democratic support. but rubio has been blocking her, under a senate rule allowing any member to hold a nomination indefinitely. senator rubio maintains his strong opposition to this nominee on the basis of her failure to be transparent during the confirmation process, inability to provide straightforward answers, and poor track record on a wide range of issues as the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, rubio spokesman alex burgos said. senators from states that border mexico held a news conference with the u.s. hispanic chamber of commerce calling for jacobsons confirmation, citing the importance of the u.s.mexico relationship. mexico is the second largest market for u.s. exports and the countrys thirdlargest trading partner. its extremely important, said republican senator jeff flake of arizona. democrat tom udall of new mexico, who tried to bring up jacobsons nomination in the senate but was blocked by republican mike lee on rubios behalf, said he was confident jacobson would be confirmed if a vote went ahead.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "no", "sign", "of", "end", "to", "fight", "on", "u", ".", "s", ".", "ambassador", "to",

{"sample_id": 1, "text": "obama to meet u.s. congress leaders monday on spending. washington reuters u.s. president barack obama has invited congressional leaders to the white house on monday in an attempt to break deadlocks over government spending plans and funding the fight against the zika virus. congress must pass a temporary spending bill by sept. 30 or much of the federal government will shut down. with the deadline approaching, obama is set to meet with house of representatives speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, both republicans. senate democratic leader harry reid and his house counterpart nancy pelosi will also be present, white house and congressional officials said on friday. of particular urgency is a program to fight the zika virus which is running out of money, u.s. center for disease control and prevention director tom frieden told reporters. frieden also noted the virus, which can cause severe birth defects, would pose a threat well into 2017. zika is likely to become endemic in this hemisphere, he told reporters. congressional leaders are considering attaching as much as 1.1 billion in zika spending to a bill to temporarily fund the government during the 2017 fiscal year that begins on oct. 1. congress has yet to approve individual appropriations bills to fund the government in fiscal 2017. if no spending is approved before the end of september, much of the government would have to shut down. house republican leaders are considering a senate republican proposal to extend the current government spending levels until dec. 9, house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers, a republican, told reporters. rogers said he wants the package to include funding to combat zika, but that this was being negotiated. on thursday, pelosi called for a temporary funding measure that would include a full years funding to combat zika. in february, obama asked congress to approve 1.9 billion in emergency funds to deal with zika. since then, both political parties have backed 1.1 billion, but fights over side issues related to abortion have divided them. one of the biggest controversies involves democrats opposition to republicanproposed language that democrats say would prevent zika funds for abortion providers like planned parenthood, mainly in puerto rico. a spending bill expiring in december would provide time this autumn for lawmakers to negotiate spending levels for the rest of fiscal 2017. some house conservatives oppose the idea, preferring to leave decisions up to the next president and a new congress

{"sample_id": 2, "text": "u.s. treads water on cyber policy as destructive attacks mount. san francisco reuters the trump administrations refusal to publicly accuse russia and others in a wave of politically motivated hacking attacks is creating a policy vacuum that security experts fear will encourage more cyber warfare. in the past three months, hackers broke into official websites in qatar, helping to create a regional crisis suspected north koreanbacked hackers closed down british hospitals with ransomware and a cyber attack that researchers attribute to russia deleted data on thousands of computers in the ukraine. yet neither the united states nor the 29member nato military alliance have publicly blamed national governments for those attacks. president donald trump has also refused to accept conclusions of u.s. intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the 2016 u.s. elections using cyber warfare methods to help the new york businessman win. the white house is currently embroiled in a cyber crisis of existential proportion, and for the moment probably just wants cyber to go away, at least as it relates to politics, said kenneth geers, a security researcher who until recently lived in ukraine and works at natos think tank on cyber defense. this will have unfortunate side effects for international cyber security. without calling out known perpetrators, more hacking attacks are inevitable, former officials said. i see no dynamics of deterrence, said exwhite house cyber security officer jason healey, now at columbia university. the government retreat is underscored by the departure at the end of july of chris painter, the official responsible for coordinating u.s. diplomacy on cyber security. no replacement has been named and the future of the position in the state department is in flux. some of trumps cyber officials have publicly highlighted a strategy to focus less on building global norms and more on bilateral agreements. trump and the kremlin have said russia and the united states are in discussions on creating a cyber security group. but at the big black hat and def con security conferences this week in las vegas the u.s. government will have an unusually light footprint. past government speakers have included a head of the national security agency and senior homeland security officials. a session featuring u.s. law enforcement officials discussing the purported theft by russia of hundreds of millions of yahoo account credentials was pulled at the last minute. a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of investigation said the presentation was canceled because the yahoo expert slated to talk, deputy assistant director eric sporre, had been reassigned to run the tampa fbi office. the policy vacuum left by the united states is also affecting private security firms, which say they have grown more cautious in publicly attributing cyber attacks to nationstates lest they draw fire from the trump administration. trump suggested in an april interview that the security firm crowdstrike, which worked on investigating the election hack of the democratic national committee, might not be trustworthy because he was told it was controlled by a ukrainian. it is not. cyber policy veterans are particularly alarmed about the lack of u.s. and nato response to the destructive attack, dubbed notpetya, in june that struck computers worldwide but was especially harmful for ukraine, which is in armed conflict with russia in the east of the country. cyber security experts, such as jim lewis of the center for strategic and international studies, a government veteran who advised former president barack obama, believe russia carried out the attack. the russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. lewis and others predicted that trump will not publicly accuse russia, and nato has only said it appears to be the work of a government agency somewhere. if you are not ringing alarm bells in an eloquent way, then i think youre dropping the ball, said retired cia officer daniel hoffman, who worked on russian issues. when we fail to do enough, that just emboldens them.", "tokens": ["[CLS]",

{"sample_id": 4, "text": "trumps pick for army secretary drops out official. washington reuters u.s. president donald trumps nominee for army secretary, mark green, withdrew his name from consideration for the position, a white house official said on friday. green, who is the third trump nominee for a service secretary position to withdraw, has faced criticism from rights groups and lawmakers over allegations about past comments regarding minorities as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or lgbt, people. in a statement, green said false and misleading attacks had driven him to withdraw. tragically, my life of public service and my christian beliefs have been mischaracterized and attacked by a few on the other side of the aisle for political gain, he said. while these false attacks have no bearing on the needs of the army or my qualifications to serve, i believe it is critical to give the president the ability to move forward with his vision to restore our military to its rightful place in the world. u.s. senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a statement that greens decision to stand down was good news for all americans. it was especially good for those who were personally vilified by his disparaging comments directed toward the lgbtq community, muslim community, latino community and more, schumer said. green served in the 160th special operations aviation regiment where he made three combat tours to the middle east.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "trump", "##s", "pick", "for", "army", "secretary", "drops", "out", "official", ".",

{"sample_id": 5, "text": "democrats spend big on this ad to expose trumps cold, dark heart video. the democratic super pac priorities usa is spending an unusually high 500,000 for a digital ad campaign featuring a powerful indictment of republican presidential nominee donald trump s cruelty towards disabled people.the ad, dante, features a 17yearold suffering from cancer and his reaction to trump s mockery of a disabled reporter.flashing cancer survivor tattoos on his forearms, dante latchman, 17, tells of surviving a rare spinalcord affliction that was diagnosed when he was 1. i ve spent my whole life fighting back, he says. he is shown watching television and seeing mr. trump mock a reporter serge kovaleski of the new york times who has a condition that limits the functioning of his joints. i don t want a president who makes fun of me, i want a president who inspires me, dante says. that s not donald trump. the ad drives home its theme a stop hate graphic flips to say stop trump as dante is seen walking down the sidewalk with his mother, his gait noticeably laborious.a previous ad also showcased a family with a disabled child recoiling in horror at trump s heartless behavior.both the official clinton campaign and priorities usa are on the air, boosting clinton and attacking trump in multiple swing states with millions of dollars in advertising. clinton recently reported that her campaign had over 40 million on hand, while trump came up extremely short with just over a million dollars.despite his claim to be a billionaire, trump has put no serious resources into his campaign and has been reluctant to do the type of fundraising that previous presidential candidates have done.outside funding is a problem for trump as well, as the super pac supporting him, restoring america now, lacks the kind of money needed to advertise in swing states. instead, they are spending money to advertise on cable news, where most of the audience is already firmly in the trump camp or against it, and unlikely to sway voing patterns.featured image via youtube", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "democrats", "spend", "big", "on", "this", "ad", "to", "expose", "trump", "##s", "cold",

{"sample_id": 6, "text": "is hillarys campaign in yuge trouble? shocking statistics show number of votes in 2016 way down from election she lost in 2008. meanwhile trump is about to make history for claiming the most votes ever in the history of the gop primaries. what was that the mainstream media keeps saying about trump not being able to beat hillary? former secretary of state hillary clinton has badly underperformed in 2016 compared with her first run for president in 2008, a new data analysis done exclusively by breitbart news shows.it s particularly telling that she s gotten fewer votes in 2016 than she did in 2008, especially because of the fact that the 2008 race was a threeway race for some time between clinton, now president barack obama, and exsen. john edwards. she was, despite being the frontrunner for some time, the ultimate loser of that race and she got more votes that year in a much more competitive primary that she ended up losing than she has this year against a devout, proud socialist in sen. bernie sanders ivt of vermont.clinton is widely expected to be the democratic nominee in 2016, but her poor performance in the primaries which many believe she should have wrapped up long ago may drag her down heading into the general election, as even many democratic voters seem to distrust her. to win in november, clinton will need a strong showing from the democrat base. this data seems to suggest that she has significant problems with her own party s core voters, meaning that if whoever wins the republican nomination is able to woo these disaffected democrats into the gop camp, there could be a blowout in november for the republican nominee.in 2016, clinton has received 12,437,734 votes so far. in the states that have already voted this cycle, when she ran and lost back in 2008, clinton received 12,727,221 votes.specifically, the data shows, clinton has seen a decline of 273,321 votes from 2008 to 2016 among states that have already voted this cycle. that 2.15 percent decrease nationally is exacerbated in several key states that clinton would need to win to secure the presidency in a general election, suggesting that she s extraordinarily weak on the electoral college scale nationally and that whoever wins the gop nomination will likely be able to thump her in the general in november. via breitbart news", "tokens":

{"sample_id": 7, "text": "trumps heartland voters shrug off global uproar over immigration ban. this version of the jan 29 story has been corrected to show former senate republican leader trent lott is from mississippi not missouri by laila kearney reuters many of president donald trumps core political supporters had a simple message on sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban calm down. the relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove trumps historic upset victory working and middleclass residents of midwest and the south provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. in the st. louis suburb of manchester, missouri, 72yearold jo ann tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate. somebody has to stand up, be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in, she said. im all for everybody to stop and take a breath just give it a chance. by executive order on friday, trump banned immigration from seven muslimmajority countries iran, iraq, syria, libya, somalia, sudan and yemen and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. in the electoral strongholds for trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. they shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country. in new york, los angeles, san francisco and other cities, trumps action set off an outpouring of anger. house minority leader nancy pelosi, a democrat from california, evoked an image of the statue of liberty weeping. senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the meanspirited and unamerican immigration ban. veterans in government agencies, including the homeland security and state departments, blasted trumps team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the white house rejected. at airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules. but allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said. louise ingram, a 69yearold retiree from troy, alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few glitches, such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect u.s. citizens from attacks. im not opposed to immigrants, she said. i just want to make sure they are safe to come in. a senior trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. they rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in san bernardino, california the boston marathon bombing and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in europe. the reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of france, germany and parts of belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the united states, one official told reuters. candace wheater, a 60yearold retired school cafeteria worker from spring lake, michigan, also referenced the attacks in brussels and paris. look at whats happening in europe, she said. i dont dare travel there, out of fear. steve hirsch, 63, from manassas, virginia, drove to washingtons dulles airport on sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did. he said he supported trumps order. a country is not a country if it doesnt have borders, he added. he lauded trumps actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security. he probably went as far as he thought he could, hirsch said. you cant ban everybody in the world, but i think its prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world. trent lott, a former senate republican leader from mississippi who is now a lawyer in washington, d.c., said the orders made sense to workingclass americans in the real world. out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border, he said. university of virginia political science professor larry sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt trump politically. his base is as firm as ever, he said. what hes lost in the very early polls is the republicans who were never trumpers and ended up voting for trump. trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites. trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the socalled rust belt, the midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns. whatever trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country. i just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about donald trump, sabato said. in baton rouge, louisiana, 40yearold teacher trista carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about trump out of the classroom. we were told to be switzerland, she said. were not allowed to take any sides or views. she has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them with no sugarcoating. i think its just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally, she said. i feel like he is going to to the best of his abilities make a lot of things he said happen.", "tokens":

{"sample_id": 8, "text": "pentagon seeks 583 billion budget for 2017 republicans say not enough. washington reuters the pentagon on tuesday proposed a 582.7 billion defense budget that emphasizes emerging threats from russia, china and islamic state rebels, but the plan is already under fire from republican lawmakers who charge it shortchanges the u.s. military. president barack obamas last budget would boost spending on the war against islamic state militants to 7.5 billion during the 2017 fiscal year, a 50 percent jump over the 5 billion approved this year. some 200 million of that would go to fight militants in north and west africa. the proposal also would quadruple funds to counter russian pressure in europe, including its seizure of ukraines crimean peninsula and repeated strategic bomber flights near nato air space. spending to boost u.s. military presence and training in europe would rise to 3.4 billion from 800 million this year. the budget heralds a strategic shift as washington looks beyond the wars in iraq and afghanistan and enters a new period of great power competition from russia and china as well as threats from smaller rivals like iran and north korea, officials said. this budget marks a major inflection point for the department of defense, defense secretary ash carter said in a statement. even as we fight todays fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come in 10, 20 or 30 years. overall, the administration is seeking a pentagon base budget of 523.9 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct. 1, plus 58.8 billion for war funding and overseas operations. the base budget is about 2.5 billion more than this years while war spending remains relatively flat, officials said. the spending proposal is in line with a congressional budget deal last year that set pentagon funding guidelines for 2016 and 2017. but republican lawmakers have criticized the war funding plan, saying the 59 billion figure in the budget deal was a floor, not a ceiling, and the president should have sought more. this request is inadequate to address the national security threats we face, senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a statement. congressman mac thornberry, chairman of the house armed services committee, accused the administration of playing budgetary games. mccain said by seeking the minimum level of war funding in the budget deal, the president had left the pentagon with 17 billion less than it estimated it would need for 2017 in last years budget. to make up the shortfall in planned spending, the pentagon cut more than 5 billion by adjusting its assumptions about expected fuel costs and inflation levels, pentagon comptroller mike mccord said. it also cut procurement to 112.1 billion, down 6 percent, from this year. the reductions would come mainly from planned aircraft purchases, including five fewer f35 joint strike fighters lmt.n and a reduction in several types of army helicoptersba.n, budget documents show. while cutting procurement, the pentagon proposed increasing spending on research and development by 4 percent, to 71.8 billion, as it looks to develop new technologies to give it a military edge. the department said it would spend 16.8 billion in its classified military intelligence accounts. it also agreed to delay until 2022 its controversial plan to retire the a10 close air support aircraft, which is being used in the fight against islamic state. retaining the aircraft will cost 3.4 billion over the fiveyear period. the budget would continue to shrink the size of the u.s. army, which will drop to 460,000 soldiers in 2017 from the current 475,000. separately, the presidents budget would fund a new 150 million polar icebreaker vessel to ensure yearround accessibility to the arctic for coast guard missions.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "pentagon", "seeks", "58", "##3", "billion", "budget", "for", "2017", "republicans", "say", "not", "enough", ".",

{"sample_id": 10, "text": "breaking report hillary supporter, ceo of las vegas mgm and mandalay bay resort asked employees to donate to cair only 2 months ago, wife worked for obama. on august 15, 2017, jim murren, ceo of mgm which owns mandalay bay casino and resort, came out with a bold statement of support for hillary clinton s presidential campaign as a lifelong registered republican, i ve crossed the aisle only a few times in elections past, and almost never at the presidential level. each time, it was a gutwrenching decision.but this year it s an easy choice. i m going to put my country ahead of my party by voting for hillary clinton and by making my firstever public endorsement of a presidential candidate. breaking from investigative reporter laura loomer exclusive in this internal memo i have obtained, jim murren, the ceo of mgm resorts which owns mandalay bay resort and casino where stephen paddock committed his massacre asked employees to donate to cair, a documented terrorist organization, two months ago.murren declared that he d match all donations from his employees to cair, and radical leftwing anti trump groups like southern poverty law center and adl antidefamation league. his wife, heather murren also worked for the obama administration on obama s commission for enhancing national cybersecurity in 2016.when this memo first came out from the mgm ceo to his employees, wayne allen root wrote in the townhall publication about his disgust for a ceo of a major company asking his employees to donate to these radical groups, many of which, are in direct conflict with conservative and christian values.why is the mgm ceo asking his employees to contribute to radical, leftwing organizations? why did the killer choose to stay in the mandalay casino? why is no one reporting about the fact that the wife of the mgm ceo worked for obama on his commission for enhancing national cybersecurity only one year ago?what about the fact that receipts that allegedly came from the mandalay casino resort show that there were 2 guests in the room with the shooter and that he actually checked in one day before the date of checkin that s being reported.again, more from investigative journalist laura loomerbreaking copies of receipts from the las vegas shooter s room service were posted by mandalay bay resort and casino room service employee tony hernandez armenta. the receipts confirm my previous reporting that stephen paddock checked into the resort prior to sept. 28. the receipts are dated sept. 27, 2017, and indicate that there were 2

{"sample_id": 11, "text": "behind the scenes, ryan touts his agenda in cleveland, not trumps. cleveland reuters u.s. house speaker paul ryan offered his strongest support yet for donald trumps white house bid on tuesday at the republican national convention, saying the new york businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides america a chance at a better way. behind the scenes in cleveland, the highestranking elected republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by trumps candidacy. the support reflects deep divisions within the party over trumps harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt american workers but establishment republicans view as central to their free trade policies. the split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of trump and ryan. everybody knows the tough spot paul ryan is in, said annie dickerson, a new york delegate to the convention and close adviser to republican financier paul singer, referring to ryans dilemma in backing a candidate as the partys standard bearer in the nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values. hes the antidote to all the frustration thats in cleveland this week, she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with trumps nomination. ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which trump was officially nominated on tuesday. but he has kept a low profile, avoiding the conventions opening day on monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of republican supporters, according to aides and attendees. at the meetings, according to attendees, ryan has been pushing his better gop platform, a sixpart agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism president george w. bush advocated reduced regulation, lower taxes, and welfare reform. it contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by trump, who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions. doug heye, a former house republican leadership aide close to ryan, said ryans platform gives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isnt divisive, that isnt name calling. heye said the approach could help ryan position himself as the face of the party if trump loses the election. ryan has publicly clashed with trump over the latters promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals. he criticized trumps call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a mexicanamerican judge racist. ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform, and as chairman of the house of representatives budget committee, he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government. the risk for ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional republican orthodoxy, and by not embracing trump he could find himself isolated. some of trumps supporters see him as emblematic of the washington dysfunction that has angered many republicans. mark bolin, a canton, ohio, business owner who supports trump, called ryans tepid endorsement of trump political suicide. he said ryan and other republicans leaders cant admit their own failures. instead of them thinking theres something wrong with their party, they think it must be us, the american people arent smart enough, bolin said. ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed ryan, who was the vice presidential nominee in 2012, to run for president this year. he declined but hasnt ruled out running in the future. advisers to singer and the billionaire industrialist koch brothers say the donors are banking on ryan to carry the flag for traditional republican values. i like ryan and his day to lead the party will come very soon, if trump loses, said energy magnate dan eberhart, another major donor. linda devore, 66, a retired attorney from fayetteville, north carolina, who met ryan for the first time in 2012, rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the cleveland. hes just one of the smartest republicans. thats what i told him, devore said. hes a quick wit. he said, pretty low bar, huh?", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "behind", "the", "scenes", ",", "ryan", "to", "##uts", "his",

{"sample_id": 12, "text": "british parliament respected institution or den of vice?. london reuters from william pitt to winston churchill, britain s finest prime ministers have risen to greatness in the palace of westminster, heightening its reputation as one of the world s most respected parliaments. but with nine centuries of history come traditions, and a culture that is now under fire for concentrating power in the hands of lawmakers who can make or break the careers of aides, interns and party activists. the resignation of britain s defense minister, who admitted repeatedly touching a radio presenter s knee in 2002, and a series of accusations against other members of parliament, from alleged extramarital affairs to sexual assaults, have prompted calls for change. parliament is an old and famous institution, said brendan chilton, a labour activist and general secretary of labour leave, a probrexit group. however it has in recent years become a den of vice. we should all seek to make parliament the envy of the world again. the ornate palace of westminster, beside the river thames in the heart of london, is home to both the upper and lower houses of parliament and is seen by some historians as one of the birthplaces of modern democracy. but allegations about british politicians, many of them unsubstantiated, have surfaced since sexual abuse claims against hollywood producer harvey weinstein prompted women and men in british politics to share stories about improper behavior. claims of sexual harassment have prompted some newspapers to refer to parliament as pestminster . michael fallon resigned as defense minister on wednesday over past behavior he said had fallen below the high standards we require of the armed forces . two more ministers are under investigation by the governing conservative party into allegations of inappropriate behavior and the opposition labour party and scottish national party are looking into similar reports about party members. aweinspiring the palace of westminster s debating chambers, its lavish tea rooms and its maze of corridors with portraits of longgone politicians and prime ministers can inspire and confuse in equal measure. like a selfcontained village, it has it own post office, hairdresser, gym, restaurants and bars. there is little reason to leave and for many workers, days are spent in its offices and evenings are spent in its bars. drinking culture is both fun and a bit depressing, one parliamentary researcher wrote on the glassdoor website where employees and former employees anonymously review companies and their management. you will miss out on networking if this is not something you want to do. it is a heady mix, and many relationships have grown in an environment where people work closely together, and often under pressure, for long hours. but the allegations that have surfaced in recent weeks also depict it as an environment where inappropriate behavior is widespread and a laddish culture, where what one person sees as a joke is offensive to another, prevails. the accusations describe parliament as a place where careers of researchers, interns and aides can be decided by the member of parliament or minister they work for and suggest some fear for their future if they refuse sexual advances. many female lawmakers have welcomed the opportunity to share their experiences, some of which they have kept silent about for years for fear of, if not reprisals, criticism from colleagues or officials for bringing parties into disrepute. there is obviously a problem, it s a good thing that it s been exposed, labour lawmaker harriet harman told parliament this week. no one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter. scandals involving members of british politicians are not new. the profumo affair, involving sex, a soviet spy and the secretary of state for war, helped bring down the conservative government in 1963. twenty years later, conservative cecil parkinson resigned as trade and industry minister over an affair with his secretary, who became pregnant. but fallon told the bbc that what had been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now . the government is introducing measures to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure. but critics say the power disparity between lawmaker and employee will remain.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "british", "parliament", "respected", "institution", "or", "den",

{"sample_id": 13, "text": "were not catalonia italys separatists tread softly toward autonomy. milan, italy reuters as nervous investors retreat from catalonia, afraid the wealthy region may secede from spain, another european region whose politicians once campaigned for independence is looking to attract some of them by talking of autonomy, not secession. the italian region of lombardy, the country s industrial engine and home to its financial capital milan, is holding a referendum on sunday for more autonomy, an outcome its onceproudly secessionist leader hopes will lure more investment. that could come at the expense of catalonia, which is a rival to lombardy in the race to attract employers fleeing another painful european divorce, brexit. the two regions are competing to host europe s drugs regulator which must leave the uk and find a new home inside the european union. we are not catalonia, said lombardy president roberto maroni, overlooking milan from his glasswalled office on the 36th floor of the region s recently built headquarters. we remain inside the italian nation with more autonomy while catalonia wants to become the 29th state of the european union. we, no. not for now. he speaks of catalonia as a competitor in some respects but says he is not deliberately courting its firms. we are not cheering because firms are fleeing catalonia. we will see what happens but i haven t had any requests yet from catalan firms. maroni is a leading member of lega nord, which began in the 1990s to campaign for an independent state of padania, stretching across italy s north, roughly following the po river from around lombardy in the west to venice in the east. lega nord no longer actively campaigns for secession but as the ruling party in lombardy and in the veneto region around venice, it is holding referendums in both for greater autonomy, including a better financial deal from the central government. a yes vote would not be binding on rome, but maroni said it would give him a strong mandate to negotiate a better deal. it s obvious that the more negotiating power i have, the more money i can manage to bring home, he said. rome says the referendum is unnecessary, though permitted under italy s constitution, which allows regions to open talks for more autonomy. italy s ruling democratic party is also neutral on the issue, though at least one of the party s mayors in lombardy is calling for a yes vote. like catalonia, lombardy makes up a fifth of the national economy and complains that the center is draining its finances. but unlike catalonia, where hundreds of firms have shifted headquarters to other regions of spain since an oct. 1 independence referendum there, lombardy s boss is taking a softer line and using his autonomy push as an investment pitch. maroni says lombardy pays 54 billion euros 64 billion more in taxes to rome each year than it receives from the center. he wants to reduce that difference by half. maroni says he would spend some of that money on research and development, nurturing familyowned businesses and startups and tax holidays to attract big international firms. for example, he said, he could tell big multinationals looking to invest in europe you know that if you come to milan, for two or three years i won t make you pay taxes. rome, though, is in no position to allow its most economically powerful region such a windfall without risking economic collapse in the alreadypoor south, experts say. it s a zerosum game, said professor luca ricolfi, an expert on federalism at the university of turin. gian claudio bressa, junior minister for regional affairs in rome, said it was not a matter of just handing back money. regions must show they can take over public services from the national government and do a better job at providing them. only then are more funds allocated to a newly autonomous region, to help it fund those additional services. italy is a unitary state based on mutual fiscal solidarity among regions, bressa said. in order to get more money from the central state, lombardy should demonstrate that the services offered are better if compared to those provided by the state itself. if 27 billion euros were to be used to fund something different from services, italy could not survive of course. even if there is a large yes vote in sunday s referendums, experts do not expect quick or dramatic change. lombardy would consider it a victory if it managed to pick up a few more responsibilities and around 12 billion euros in additional funds, said the university of turin s ricolfi. politically, though, it could inflame tensions between the rich north and poor south, and weaken the seams of a nation that was a collection of small regional states, speaking a variety of dialects, until unification in the 19th century. once you open up the issue of what the northern regions pay, then i expect a backlash in southern italy, said giovanni orsina, history professor at rome s luissguido carli university. 1 0.8504 euros", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "were", "not", "catalonia", "italy", "##s", "sep", "##arat", "##ists", "tread", "softly",

{"sample_id": 14, "text": "bill maher explains how every republican can change except on this one issue video. during the new rules segment of real time with bill maher, maher gave a hilarious analysis of republican s hypocrisy, how they flipflop only when it happens to them, and what that means for the planet.maher tosses off a litany of examples of individual republicans who have completely changed their minds about issues as soon as those issues found their ways into their lives. maher says it explains why john mccain supports every form of war ever invented and some he just fantasizes about in the shower but torture? no, because he was tortured by sarah palin. it explains why ronald reagan suddenly cared about aids only after it struck his friend rock hudson. and why nancy reagan got religion on stem cell research after ronnie got alzheimer s. and it explains why newt gingrich gave up hunting after he married an owl. that s good news for people on the right side of history already. most republican politicians eventually catch up with the rest of class on most issues. it may take a long time and a lot of work but public opinion shifts and they must shift along with it.the problem is if having a personal stake in the matter is the spark that helps create that shift, issues that are more recondite in nature can be almost impossible for them to change their minds on. issues like climate change just won t become a major issue for most republicans.maher makes fun of this, hoping that the gods of irony hit republicans with problems caused by environmental destruction. let rush limbaugh be attacked by a swarm of dying bees and the koch brothers be swallowed up by a frackinginduced earthquake. and to slap the global warming denial out of marco rubio whose own state of florida is one of the most likely places to be inundated by rising oceans his own home must get flooded and marco must be swept out to sea and washed up all the way back to cuba, where we will find out that marco rubio is really elian gonzalez. you can watch the clip below image from video screenshot", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "bill", "ma", "##her", "explains", "how", "every",

{"sample_id": 16, "text": "atlantic city, n.j., emergency manager suggests privatizing fire department. reuters atlantic city, the distressed new jersey gambling hub, should consider privatizing its firefighting services and convention center and find ways to make more money off its drinking water utility, the citys emergency manager said in an updated fiscal rescue plan. the report comes one year after governor chris christie appointed kevin lavin as emergency manager. lavins report, which also calls for additional layoffs, follows an initial assessment last march. new jersey taxpayers have so far spent 2.62 million on lavin and his team of accountants, restructuring lawyers and a mediator, according to invoices obtained and reviewed by reuters through public records requests. im glad the emergency manager has, after spending millions of dollars in nobid contracts and wasting months of time, concluded what we all know that atlantic city government is broken and needs to be fixed immediately, senate president steve sweeney said in a statement. sweeney is now pushing for a full state takeover of atlantic city operations that would strip elected officials of nearly all power. lavin said in a statement that over the past year his office and city stakeholders have kept the city from falling into financial ruin by tackling a 100 million budget deficit. unfortunately, our momentum has been stalled by parochial politics that continue to inhibit progress, all to the detriment of the taxpayers of atlantic city, he said. many of the most critical and financially important issues need to be addressed urgently. he said the city should consider privatizing the entertainment and sports arena boardwalk hall and should regionalize municipal services, including police. the city is facing tough odds. its school district is projecting a budget deficit of up to 55 million in fiscal 2017. atlantic city also has at least 190 million of casino tax appeals and other unbonded debt. in part because of that, the citys ability to raise public funds in order to repay the unbonded debt is highly unlikely, the report said the report found that the city does not qualify for adequate financing under the states qualified bond act, which it used in the past to issue bonds because its credit rating is at junk status. mayor don guardian said in a statement he would review the report. i fully recognize that much work still needs to be done to fix the problems that have accumulated over the past 30 years, he said.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "atlantic", "city",

{"sample_id": 17, "text": "jimmy carter koreans want peace treaty to replace 1953 ceasefire. 21st century wire says reframing the current diplomatic crisis in north korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situation.former us president jimmy carter is suggesting just that. but will the hawks in washington listen?. the carter centerthe harsh rhetoric from washington and pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries, and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the united states and north korea. in addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between north korea and other countries, especially china and russia. the recent un security council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help. in all cases, a nuclear exchange must be avoided. all parties must assure north koreans they we will forego any military action against them if north korea remains peaceful.president jimmy carteri have visited north korea three times, and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect u.s.dprk relations.in june 1994, i met with kim il sung in a time of crisis, when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the international atomic energy agency and to seek mutual agreement with the united states on a permanent peace treaty, to have summit talks with the president of south korea, to expedite the recovery of the remains of american service personnel buried in his country, and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula. kim il sung died shortly after my visit, and his successor, kim jong il, notified me and leaders in washington that he would honor the promises made by his father. these obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in geneva by robert gallucci and other representatives of the clinton administration.i returned to pyongyang in august 2010, at the invitation of north korean leaders, to bring home aijalon gomes, an american who had been detained there. my last visit to north korea was in may 2011 when i led a delegation of elders former presidents of ireland and finland and former prime minister of norway to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy people.during all these visits, the north koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the united states and their neighbors, but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country. they wanted a peace treaty especially with america to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the korean war in 1953, and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period. they have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any american attack. the influence of china in pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since kim jong un became the north korean leader in december 2011.a commitment to peace by the united states and north korea is crucial.when this confrontational crisis is ended, the united states should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953. the united states should make this clear, to north koreans and to our allies.read more north korea news at 21st

{"sample_id": 18, "text": "hey democrats! judicial watch just discovered hillary invited putin to 2009 clinton foundation galais this the collusion youve been looking for?. the march 13, 2009, email from the clinton foundation showed that putin and about 200 other leaders including others just as controversial were invited to attend a gathering that occurred at about the same time that the newly appointed secretary of state was attempting a reset with moscow.the email, which was sent from clinton foundation director of foreign policy amitabh desai to assistant secretary of state andrew shapiro and then forwarded to top clinton aide jake sullivan, also highlights the potential massive conflict of interest between a nonprofit foundation and the federal government.even after losing the election, clinton has continued on the warpath against president trump s stance on russia. he doesn t just like putin, he wants to be like putin, clinton said of trump on msnbc s rachel maddow show thursday night.but as secretary of state, clinton took pains to engage with the kremlin. just one week prior to sending out the invites, hillary flew to geneva and presented the russian foreign minister with an actual reset button to symbolize a new beginning in u.s.russia relations.beyond the putin invite, many serious conflicts of interests arose from the sitting secretary of state s invite list.judicial watch explains furtherthe list includes dignitaries from saudi arabia, which gave 14.5 million to the clinton foundation kuwait, which gave between 5 and 10 million oman, the united arab emirates, and qatar all of which donated between 1 and 5 million over the years. in february 2015, the washington post reported, a third of foundation donors who have given more than 1 million are foreign governments or other entities and foreign donors make up more than half of those who have given more than 5 million. conservative reviewhere is the first page of the email obtained

{"sample_id": 19, "text": "trump plays down postbrexit market turmoil on aberdeen visit. aberdeen, scotland reuters u.s. presidential candidate donald trump played down market turmoil in the wake of britains decision to leave the european union on a visit to his trump international golf course in aberdeen on saturday. wearing an opennecked shirt, a suit and a white baseball cap with his slogan make america great again, trump was asked if he was worried about the volatility in financial markets following britains vote to leave the eu on thursday. theres always turmoil no matter where you go, no matter what you do, he said. global stock markets lost about 2 trillion in value on friday after the vote, while sterling fell to a 31year low. trump, whose mother was scottish, was greeted by around a dozen protesters at the course waving mexican flags, rainbow flags for gay pride day and signs that read donald stop the hating and shame on you for ruining a beautiful landscape. trump last year proposed a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states as a response to islamist attacks in paris and california, causing a furor in europe. in an article in a scottish newspaper earlier this year, trump pointed to his determination to overcome local opposition to his golf course projects as an example of the leadership skills that americans would get if he were to become president. he also met with news corporation media mogul rupert murdoch and his wife jerry hall, giving them a tour of the course in a golf cart.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "trump", "plays", "down", "post", "##bre",

declaring donald trumps running mate was in excellent health. you are medically able to maintain your high level of professional work and your physical activity programs without limitations, wrote michael busk of the st. vincent health, wellness and preventative care institute in indianapolis. trump, the republican nominee for president, has released a note from his doctor saying that he, too, was in excellent health. hillary clinton, the democratic candidate in the nov. 8 presidential election, and her running mate, tim kaine, also released medical information this week. the candidates moved to show their physical fitness to run for office after clinton fell ill on sunday at an event in new york city, prompting her campaign to disclose that she had been diagnosed with noncontagious, bacterial pneumonia. busk said in the letter dated thursday that he last examined pence, who is the governor of indiana, in july and has been his doctor since 2013. pence exercises four days a week, mainly by biking, and takes no medications except for seasonal allergies. he had hernia repair surgery in 2015 and had basal cell carcinomas, a common form of skin cancer, removed in 2002 and 2010, the letter said. pences father died of a heart attack, the letter said. but it said his father smoked cigarettes, while pence neither smokes nor drinks alcohol. pences cardiologists feel he has a very good and strong heart, the letter said.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "republican", "vp", "candidate", "pen", "##ce", "in", "excellent", "health", "doctor", ".", "reuters", "u", ".", "s", ".", "republican",

{"sample_id": 22, "text": "obama expected to release plan to close gitmoand give it back to cuba?. there s so much to this effort to close gitmo that it s hard to know where to begin. first of all, one of obama s campaign promises was to close gitmo. here we are late in his second term and he s still doing everything he can to close this prison for terrorists. we ve dumped millions into the facility, even building a 750,000 soccer field. the republicans have been blocking obama s efforts but it s looking more and more like an executive order will be the only way gitmo will close. the second aspect of this obama plan is that obama may give gitmo back to cuba. raul castro voiced a desire to have gitmo returned back in januarycuba president raul castro said that if the united states wants to smooth relations, then the united states must first turn over guantanamo bay. the reestablishment of diplomatic relations is the start of a process of normalizing bilateral relations, but this will not be possible while the blockade still exists, while they don t give back the territory illegally occupied by the guantanamo naval base, mr. castro said, ap reported.gitmo was established by the united states in 1903. cuba has been demanding the united states give it over to its authority for decades.i wouldn t put it past obama to give guantanamo bay back to cuba. this is clearly a political move by obama who s protecting his legacy over the safety and security of the american people. can you imagine having these terrorists housing in the city you live in?the pentagon is expected to release a plan next week on president obama s yearslong effort to close the guantanamo bay detention center that suggests a colorado prison dubbed the alcatraz of the rockies as one suitable site to relocate expected lifelong detainees, obama administration officials say.obama made a campaign promise in his 2008 white house bid to close the facility, arguing the move would be in the united states best financial, national security and foreign policy interests and in the name of justice considering some of the detainees have been held for nearly nine years without trial or sentencing.however, critics of the promise, including many republicans, fear transferring detainees to the u.s. mainland as part of an overall closure plan poses too much of a homeland security risk. they also say the president has yet to submit a closure plan and have been critical of the administration recently allowing some known terrorists to return to the middle east.the florence, colo., prison is among seven u.s. facilities in colorado, kansas and south carolina being considered.the pentagon plan represents a lastgasp effort by the administration to convince staunch opponents in congress that dangerous detainees who can t be transferred safely to other countries should be housed in a u.s.based prison. read more fox news", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "obama", "expected", "to",

{"sample_id": 23, "text": "in white house conference call about iran, staffers talked about blowup dolls. the contrast between the obama white house and the trump white house seems to grow more and more stark every single day. while you d struggle to find a real scandal during president obama s entire two terms, it would be nearly impossible to count the number of scandals currently plaguing the trump white house.more than that, though, it seems that the staff has given up trying to be professional. during a conference call on monday, about one of the most pressing issues in international relations, iran, staffers were heard in the background chatting about things like lesbian blowup dolls. i kid you not.two reporters, tara mckelvey of the bbc and jackie alemany of cbs both tweeted about the background chatter.during the briefing call on iran, you could hear an ad in the background a man seemed to be saying inflatable dolls and a lesbian. tara mckelvey july 18, 2017i may never know what was really said during that call or if i heard things wrong. but i ll certainly remember the sounds and those words tara mckelvey july 18, 2017trump wh still struggles w conference calls. v weird oh comment from unmuted caller during iran briefing my inflatable doll is a lesbian. jackie alemany july 18, 2017this may be the first time trump staffers were caught talking about sex dolls, but it s not the first time they were caught not taking advantage of the mute button. a conference call on the budget in may was described this wayas mulvaney attempted to answer questions, open phone lines featuring a crying baby, an intermittent hacking cough, and patriotic holdmusic quickly drowned him out. some reporters eventually unmuted their phones, revolting with laughter and exclamations of disbelief over the line. there has to be a better system, a reporter on the call complained over the tune of yankee doodle dandy.source cbs newstrump has been at this for six months now. he brands himself as a great leader and he is extremely critical of the appearances of others if not his own. the out of control conference calls are an easy thing to fix, yet his staff refuses. that s not leadership. that s chaos, which, if you think about it, is the perfect metaphor for everything trump.featured image via drew angerergetty images", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "in", "white", "house",

{"sample_id": 24, "text": "u.s. senate banking panel sets hearing for obamas sec nominees. reuters the u.s. senate banking committee has set a hearing date for president barack obamas two nominees to the securities and exchange commission, a move that follows democrats complaints about a backlog of nominations. the committees hearing for the nominees, democrat lisa fairfax and republican hester peirce, will take place on march 15, more than five months after obama announced their selection, according to a schedule published on tuesday. senate banking committee democrats, in a letter on feb. 22, asked the panels chairman, republican senator richard shelby, to clear the backlog of 16 nominations by obama to posts related to financial oversight, national security and other areas. if confirmed, fairfax and peirce would restore the secs commission to five members. the agency has been overseen by three commissioners since last year when republican daniel gallagher and democratic luis aguilar stepped down. the situation has heightened the agencys challenges in recent years of getting a consensus. only three sec commissioners remain kara stein is a democrat mike piwowar, a republican and chair mary jo white, an independent. on feb. 22, white said that she intends to wait until the sec once again has a full fivemember panel before moving forward to appoint a new head of the public company accounting oversight board, a body created in the wake of the enron scandal to police corporate auditors. another topic that has proven particularly controversial at the sec are regulatory waivers. banks and other companies that break criminal laws or face civil fraud charges must apply to the agency for waivers to keep operating normally. last year, commissioner stein began publicly dissenting on waivers, saying the agency was too often rubberstamping them and creating a policy of toobigtobar. obama tapped fairfax and peirce after months of delays and pressure from liberal groups to nominate someone who will be tough on wall street.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "u", ".", "s", ".", "senate", "banking", "panel", "sets", "hearing", "for", "obama", "##s", "sec",

{"sample_id": 25, "text": "hilarious team trump panicking as pop stars reject his hate, refuse to show up for inauguration. donald trump s transition effort has already been an embarrassing, chaotic affair. it s been more like a reality show and a quest for public humiliation and revenge than the dignified affair that it has been for presidents past. now, team trump has another problem the inauguration. you see, usually, presidentselect have pop stars and other alist stars from around the globe scrambling to get a spot at the plum event. for instance, barack obama had the likes of beyonce and aretha franklin celebrating his swearing in. not the case, however, for donald trump. in fact, the opposite seems to be true.according to bbc news, the trump team is so desperate for inaugural talent that they are actually offering to pay the stars to come something that never happens. of course, trump s inaugural committee is denying this, saying via spokesman boris epshteyn no one with any official position at, or official relationship with, the presidential committee is engaging in the conduct described. of course, this is likely a lie, since another mouthpiece from trump s inaugural clown car lied and said that sir elton john would be showing up. as soon as that news was out of the box, sir elton s publicist released a stronglyworded rebuke of team trump that said incorrect. he will not be performing. there is no truth in this at all. further, a source close to the inaugural efforts said of the team s desperation they re calling managers, agents, everyone in town to see who they can get and it s been problematic. they are willing to pay anything. other stars weighed in as well. singer john legend says that he is not surprised at all, and continued creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate. we tend to be more liberalminded. when we see somebody that s preaching division and hate and bigotry, it s unlikely he ll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him. queen frontman and american idol star adam lambert said of the potential gig, even if there was lots of cash involved i don t think i would take the money on that one. i don t think i d be endorsing that. they might struggle. less wellknown singer matt healy, who fronts the 1975, seemed to think the whole thing might be good for a laugh i ll do it if they give me cash up front. then watch what would happen. it would be a riot. even the comedy isn t enough for healy, though, as he continued what do i want? well, he s got gold seatbelts in his plane so at least a million quid. well, this ought to be an interesting affair. it will probably look like the republican national convention did, with people like pastor mark burns and sheriff clarke giving hateful, hellfire and brimstone speeches, with chris christie once again prosecuting hillary clinton from the stage, protesters outside, and with the only musical talent being people like kid rock and ted nugent.get ready for another national disgrace courtesy of donald trump, folks. murica.featured image via chip somodevillagetty images", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "hilarious", "team", "trump", "panic",

{"sample_id": 26, "text": "dont take your kids to new orleans to learn about american historyblack lives matter just erased it. it s a sad day in america when we allow the left to destroy american history the mayor of new orleans wanted treasured cultural monuments removed and he got what he wished for at the expense of the citizens of the city we will no longer allow the confederacy to literally be put on a pedestal in the heart of our city. new orleans mayor mitch landrieuthe city of new orleans removed the first of four confederate monuments this morning in an effort to appease those who believe the monuments represent racism or pretty much anything else they object to. by erasing our past, do we change anything?some on twitter are saying new orleans starts taking down confederate statues, like isis did in the middle east removing the history of our lives. it s not that we can compare religious persecution to a cleansing of history but it does have some similarities.emotions are running high because this involves a time in our history that brother fought brother and died should we forget the struggle and refuse to honor those who fought and died? isn t it true that we should always remember history and learn from it?we should also honor the soldiers who fought and died no matter what!a letter from a patriot who makes the case for keeping the monumentsby william mcmichaelany longhorn will proudly declare that the university of texas is more than an academic institution. the university is a beacon a promise that texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. however, the removal of the jefferson davis statue from the main mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.i believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the confederacy to museums. its legacy haunts the united states in ways that many will never understand. recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the civil war inflicted. however, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of confederacy continue to stand on the south mall.in fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the university worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. much like the university, the main mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. the university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the north and south. less than 50 years after the end of the civil war, sons of union and confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of france during world war i. their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.the south mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the confederacy, a sign that the era of jefferson davis, robert e. lee, and albert sidney johnston would no longer govern texas. however, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of texas hope for a progressive future president woodrow wilson, gov. jim hogg, and senator john reagan a former confederate sympathizer who encouraged texas to rejoin the union.the statues look center toward a statute of george washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. the littlefield fountain bears a latin inscription that translates to read short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. ultimately, the south mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that texas can triumph in spite of its past. yet rather than explain the main mall s history and purpose to the public, the university allowed errant voices to rule the day. as a result, future generations will likely forget the main mall s importance altogether. the moral of the story will be no more.longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances. fight for worthwhile causes, and remember your history. it will make you better, and thereby prompt you to change the world.mcmichael lives in waco. he graduated with his bachelor s degree from the university of texas in 2014.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "don", "##t", "take", "your", "kids", "to", "new", "orleans", "to", "learn", "about", "american", "history", "##bla", "##ck", "lives", "matter", "just",

{"sample_id": 28, "text": "deadly somalia blast reveals flaws in intelligence efforts. nairobimogadishu reuters the size and methods of the latest truck bombing in mogadishu show how international and somali government efforts to stop the killings are failing, partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed, security sources say. more than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the horn of africa nation. the islamist insurgency al shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely. somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said hussein moalim mohamud sheikh ali, a former national security adviser to the president. the national security architecture is in tatters, he told reuters. the shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state. the increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in somalia ahead of the withdrawal of african union peacekeepers at the end of the year. they also are a concern for other countries in the region where al shabaab is active, such as kenya and uganda. in 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by nairobibased thinktank sahan research. initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say. competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices ieds, four western and one somali security source told reuters. a letter from somalia s minister of internal security addressed to the united states, britain and the united nations in may complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence. multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counterterrorism efforts, said the letter, seen by reuters. the pressure is building on president mohamed abdullahi mohamed, who must ensure somalia s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000strong au force leaves. his government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint u.s.somali raid on bariire in august that residents say killed 10 civilians. political disagreements threaten cooperation between somalia s federal and regional forces. last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. the interior ministry spokesman resigned this week. somali police did not respond to requests for comment. highgrade explosives obtaining highgrade military explosives the material that makes a bomb explode involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else. making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the sahan report and an upcoming report from a u.n. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on somalia. according to the u.n. report which is due to be published next month, the u.s. terrorist explosive device analytical center, which is funded by the federal bureau of investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicleborne bomb incidents since 2016. the potential use of hme homemade explosive by al shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious allowing the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its ieds, said the report. al shabaab, which wants to overthrow somalia s u.n.backed government and impose strict islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for saturday s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed. mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said. a former top al shabaab commander, mukhtar robow abu mansur, condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. robow defected to the government in august after the u.s. government removed a 5 million bounty for his capture. two mogadishubased security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to reuters. they said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit mogadishu international airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a european union military training mission. one bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb, one of the western security contractors told reuters. they also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base. the driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said. a larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as kilometer five. panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck. i could see the truck speeding. i also heard few gunshots behind it. police must have been chasing it, said mohamed ali, 21, who was injured in the blast. as it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. what followed was the blast and smoke. the fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves. the driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated. three security sources told reuters he identified himself as al shabaab.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "deadly", "somalia", "blast",

ties to a us based terror organization, who according to authorities, was caught planning to deliver a large cache of weapons to a secretive islamic compound in upstate new york allowed to roam the streets while he awaits a trial that won t take place until november? this incredible story should make every american wonder how serious we are about fighting homegrown terrorism in the united states a longtime associate of a u.s.based islamist terrorist organization, muslims of america moa, was arrested in new york following the discovery of a large cache of weapons that were intended for moa s islamberg headquarters in hancock, ny.ramadan abdullah, 64, was arrested in johnson city, ny, and is no stranger to law enforcement. abdullah was previously arrested along with another man in 1977 for attempting to rob a brooklyn candy store, resulting in a murder.at the time, police searched abdullah s home and discovered enough material to build 50 bombs. even so, the charges against abdullah were ultimately reduced.abdullah was arrested on may 31 after attempting to steal four boxes of ammunition from a local gander mountain store. when asked by police about the purpose of the ammunition, abdullah s answers raised suspicion among police who obtained a search warrant for a storage locker he was renting in the town of union.during the search, the police discovered the following8 assault weapons 4 loaded handguns 1 loaded shotgun 2 rifles 64 highcapacity ammunition feeding devices flak jacketsthousands of rounds of ammunition, including .50caliber armorpiercing roundspolice searched other residences linked to abdullah and found a loaded handgun, and more highcapacity ammunition feeding devices and ammunition, including .38caliber rounds.new york state police major jim barnes declined to confirm whether abdullah was associated with terrorist groups or organizations but noted that police believe abdullah had traveled overseas. there s no indications there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence. however, it begs the question, what was he doing with all this and what were his intentions down the road? barnes said.johnson city police chief brent dodge said, it s just a tremendous blessing to be able to take all these high power weapons and high power ammunition off the streets, and who knows what kind of large scale tragedy that this investigation may have prevented later down the road. abdullah is a longtime associate of the u.s.based islamist cult muslims of america.apparently, a muslim man with a large cache of weapons set to be delivered to a secretive islamic compound in upstate new york, who also has a prior criminal record, doesn t pose enough of a security threat in the eyes of the judge, to keep him in jail until he is tried. the johnson city man facing 16 charges in a massive weapons bust was granted release on bond tuesday, as he awaits a nov. 13 trial in broome county court.ramadan abdullah, 64, has pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging more than a dozen felonies connected to his arrest in june, which police described as being one of the area s largest gun takedowns in recent memory.judge kevin dooley granted abdullah s release from jail on bond tuesday, after defense lawyer matthew ryan presented the court with two binghamton properties that would be put up for collateral.moa, which has been described as a terrorist organization in documents from the fbi and other agencies. a 2003 file says moa is linked to terrorists in pakistan, including alqaeda affiliates.the group s headquarters is a 70acre compound in hancock, ny called islamberg. it is just a 50minute drive from where abdullah was arrested.dennis michael lynch visited islamberg to see what was really going on in the remote islamic compound. here is a clip from his visitmoa is led by a radical cleric in pakistan named sheikh mubarak ali gilani, who demands a cultish loyalty from his followers in america. gilani indoctrinates them to follow a hatefilled extremist ideology that includes violent jihad against perceived enemies of islam and a belief that they are fulfilling apocalyptic prophecies.the group has claimed to have 22 islamic villages across the u.s., mostly in rural areas, which have been used as guerilla training compounds. the group also has a history of committing acts of terrorism and crimes including murder, gun smuggling, narcotics trafficking and money laundering.a 2007 fbi report warns that moa possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the u.s. it says members of the moa are encouraged to travel to pakistan to receive religious and militaryterrorist training from sheikh gilani. confidential sources inside moa say that ramadan abdullah has been a significant member of the group since it first formed in the united states in 1980 and helped buy the land that became islamberg. additional research substantiates their

{"sample_id": 31, "text": "in blustery call, trump pressured mexico on border wall payment. washington reuters president donald trump pressured the mexican president to stop voicing opposition in public to his plan to have mexico pay for a border wall, according to transcripts of phone calls published on thursday that gave an insight into trumps attempts to influence foreign leaders in his first days in office. the washington post published texts of sometimes fraught calls with mexicos enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull just days after the republican took office on jan. 20. the substance of the calls has previously been reported but the lengthy transcripts reveal trump, whose first elected office is the presidency, trying to use a mixture of bluster, tough talk and charm as he fully enters the world of diplomacy. trump argued with turnbull over refugees in an acrimonious call on jan. 28 which the new u.s. president told his counterpart was unpleasant. in a jan. 27 call, trump pressed pena nieto to avoid saying in public that mexico would not fund the planned border wall. but he complimented the mexican leaders beautiful words and said he hoped mexico would change its constitution to allow pena nieto to extend his stay in office. the proposed wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the united states, is a bone of contention between mexico and washington. pena nieto has repeatedly rejected trumps promise that mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction. trump told the mexican leader in the call that if you are going to say that mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then i do not want to meet with you guys anymore because i cannot live with that, according to the transcript. you cannot say that to the press, trump said. pena nieto had earlier scrapped a plan to hold talks with trump in the united states due to tensions over the wall and trade. the two men have since met, holding talks at a summit of the group of 20 nations in germany last month. the white house has said the u.s. government will pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work. both the white house and mexicos foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on thursday about the release of the call transcripts. it was the latest in a series of leaks from inside trumps administration which have angered the president. the republican won some sympathy over leaks from a political opponent on thursday. i am alarmed at leaks of conversations between two heads of state, democratic u.s. senator brian schatz wrote on twitter. it doesnt matter what i think of this president, this is terrible. in the conversation with pena nieto, trump said both leaders were in a little bit of a political bind due to trumps campaign pledge to build the wall and have mexico foot the bill. i have to have mexico pay for the wall i have to. i have been talking about it for a twoyear period, trump said. he suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked. they are going to say, who is going to pay for the wall, mr. president? to both of us, and we should both say, we will work it out, trump said. it will work out in the formula somehow. as opposed to you saying, we will not pay and me saying, we will not pay, the u.s. president said. pena nieto said he understood trumps position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking a creative way to jump over this obstacle. toward the end of their conversation, trump responded effusively to a comment by pena nieto about the mexican leaders wish for a constructive relationship with the united states. your words are so beautiful. those are beautiful words and i do not think i can speak that beautifully, okay? trump said. i want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in mexico so that you can run again for another six years, he said. by law, mexican presidents can only serve one sixyear term. drug infestedden in comments likely to upset voters in new hampshire an important early voting state in the u.s. presidential election primaries trump described the state as a druginfested den. i won new hampshire because new hampshire is a druginfested den, he said, complaining that drugs from mexico are damaging the united states. while trump won the republican primary there, he narrowly lost the state to democratic rival hillary clinton in the general election. new hampshire officials from both parties lashed out at trump, with several saying his push to repeal the obamacare healthcare law would worsen the nations opioid crisis. speaking to australias turnbull, trump became irritated that the united states was expected to honor an agreement made by his democratic predecessor, barack obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in australian processing centers on remote pacific islands. trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the united states, according to the transcript. this is going to kill me. i am the worlds greatest person that does not want to let people into the country, trump said. seeking to win trumps support, turnbull on friday said washington could honor the deal while taking as few as 100 refugees from the two offshore centers, should the rest fail to satisfy its vetting. it has always been subject to american vetting procedures, turnbull told reporters in western australia state. those procedures from the department of homeland security are ongoing. the dialogue was a frank conversation between adults, he added. trump told turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day, after speaking to russian president vladimir putin and others. i have had it. i have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all

{"sample_id": 32, "text": "medical examiner finally releases report on death of music icon prince. the world reeled when beloved musical icon prince rogers nelson known simply as prince suddenly died at the age of 57 on april 21 of this year. music and pop culture lovers everywhere have mourned this iconic man s death and wondered how a seemingly healthy pop star could just drop dead at such a relatively young age, but we need wait no longer, as the medical examiner s report on the reason for his death has finally been released.apparently, prince was prescribed fentanyl, which is a an opioid painkiller that is even stronger than morphine. it is also said to be highly addictive. prince s official cause of death is reported as fentanyl toxicity, and the medical examiner s report says that the overdose was accidental. the decedent selfadministered fentanyl, the report said.the drug enforcement administration was a key part of the investigation into the superstar s death, as the prescription he was taking for pain was present when he was found unresponsive in an elevator at his minnesota compound. it had also become known that prince was addicted to the drug, and was reportedly working on seeking help from an addiction doctor. unfortunately, that help did not come in time to save his life.this is the story of so many stars. they have the money and the connections to get almost anything they like for the right price, and it often ends in these kinds of tragedies. the same thing was true of michael jackson s untimely passing as well, and he was around the same age as prince when we lost him as well.prince apparently left no will to dictate who will receive his multimillion dollar estate, or who will receive the royalties from his incredibly large discography collection. a court will decide where all of his money, his properties, and other belongings will go.rest in peace, prince. hopefully, your death will wake hollywood doctors up and stop them from bowing to the wills of celebrities instead of doing what is safe and right.featured image via michael ochs archivesgetty images", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "medical", "examiner", "finally",

{"sample_id": 33, "text": "u.s. businesses fear nafta doomed mexico warns of consequences. mexico citywashington reuters the most powerful u.s. business lobby accused the trump administration of making poison pill proposals to sabotage nafta on tuesday, as mexicos foreign minister said the demise of the regional trade pact would hurt bilateral cooperation. the process of renegotiating the 23yearold north american free trade agreement has turned increasingly acrimonious. mexico accuses u.s. president donald trump of spoiling for a protectionist war with proposals aimed at balancing trade. mexican foreign minister luis videgaray said on tuesday that an end to nafta would mark a breaking point in u.s.mexican relations and affect bilateral cooperation in other areas. mexico is a key partner of the united states in fighting drug trafficking and stemming illegal immigration across the u.s. southern border. videgaray spoke after trump warned again that he would like to scrap the treaty that created one of the worlds biggest trade blocs. i happen to think that nafta will have to be terminated if were going to make it good, trump said in an interview with forbes published on tuesday. the mexican peso weakened for the fifth straight session on tuesday amid the increased tensions, and hit its weakest level against the dollar since early june. a fourth round of negotiations starting in washington on wednesday to modernize nafta has been prolonged by two days to oct. 17, two sources in mexico said. trumps hardline position did not appear to have wide support ahead of the talks, with many u.s. businesses and farmers lining up to back the existing agreement. speaking in mexico city, thomas donohue, the u.s. chamber of commerces president and chief executive, listed several u.s. proposals that he said would undermine 1 trillion in annual trilateral trade, including a sunset clause to force regular negotiations. his comments marked the second broadside the chamber has launched against the trump administrations stance on nafta in less than a week. it has argued repeatedly that the trade pact is critical to u.s. industries such as agriculture and manufacturing. there are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal, donohue said at an event hosted by the american chamber of commerce of mexico, where he said the existential threat to nafta threatened regional security. u.s. officials have suggested incorporating a sunset clause in nafta that would kill it unless it was renegotiated every five years. the officials have also suggested eliminating a key dispute resolution mechanism, much to the dismay of canada. donohue singled out plans to make automakers source more parts in north america, as well as proposed changes to the dispute resolution mechanism as obstacles to naftas renewal. he also cited plans to limit canadian and mexican access to u.s. government procurement rules. automakers in mexico say excessive content requirements could do serious damage to the industrys competitiveness. the impact would be the opposite of whats intended u.s. industry would source more inputs from asia and less from the u.s. thats right this proposal would actually send business overseas, donohue said. he also slammed the emphasis placed by the white house on reducing the u.s. trade deficit. its the wrong focus and is impossible to achieve without crippling the economy, he said. the chamber sent a letter to the white house on tuesday signed by more than 300 local u.s. business groups in support of nafta. the united states, mexico and canada began renegotiating nafta this summer. trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw if he does not win concessions to reduce a u.s. trade deficit of around 64 billion with mexico. the president has strongly criticized this agreement for years. we realize that as bad as it has been for us, it has been great for mexico and canada. naturally they will defend this lopsided accord, u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer said on tuesday. to rebalance will require substantial change and not mere tweaking. the president has vowed to bring jobs and investment back to america. we will do no less, he added.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "u", ".", "s", ".", "businesses", "fear", "na", "##ft", "##a", "doomed", "mexico", "warns", "of", "consequences", ".",

rep. cummings would be the first to let everyone know how outraged he was if this what a white congressman a lyft car adorned with congressional plates that went viral on social media belongs to rep. elijah e. cummings dmd., the washington post reported tuesday.a photo submitted to local washington, d.c., blog popville last week depicted a black honda with a pink lyft driver sticker on its window shield and the words maryland u.s. congress 7a on its license plates.cummings told the washington post that his daughter who just graduated from howard university has been using the car to drive for lyft and earn extra income. in an effort to earn some extra money to pay her expenses at school, she signed up for a parttime position with one of the ridesharing companies, cummings said. they, in turn, gave her a sticker to apply to the windshield of the car. cummings added that he has asked his daughter to remove the congressional plates, which afford special parking privileges for members and staffers.allen b. west elected to the house in 1996, cummings is coming up on his 20th year representing maryland s 7th congressional district which includes over half of baltimore city and most of howard county. his district contains some of maryland s most black precincts, precincts in which statistics for crime and incarceration, homelessness, economic development, school dropout, unemployment, drug conviction and outofwedlock birth rates all are consistently worse than both state and federal levels for all those same statistical categories.yet despite these facts, cummings believes its time for everybody else to realize that black lives matter.in a piece published on afro.com cummings laid out his plan new plan, enacting black lives matter into law , stating in part america is at an historic crossroads. either we will move forward in 2016 with public policies that support greater opportunity for everyone or we will continue to sink deeper into economic inequality, injustice and violence. these are the stakes in our current political struggles and this is why black lives should matter for everyone. it s not the first time congressional cars have come under the spotlight. roll call s video of rep. eleanor holmes norton dd.c. performing a botched park job outside the capitol went viral last year. via the hill", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "race",

{"sample_id": 37, "text": "justice department settles with conservative groups over irs scrutiny. reuters the u.s. justice department has reached a settlement with dozens of conservative groups that claimed the internal revenue service unfairly scrutinized them based on their political leanings when they sought a taxexempt status, court documents showed. in a pair of lawsuits filed in federal court in 2013, the conservative groups accused the irs of targeting organizations with such words as tea party or patriots when they applied to the agency for taxexempt status starting in 2010. the sides asked the united states district court for the district of columbia on wednesday to issue a declarative judgment in one of the cases involving 41 plaintiffs that would say the irs was wrong to apply the united states tax laws based on an entitys name, position or association with a particular political movement. we hope that todays settlement makes clear that this abuse of power will not be tolerated, attorney general jeff sessions said in a statement on thursday. the irs admitted it was wrong when it based screenings of the groups applications on their names or policy positions, subjected the groups to heightened scrutiny and delays and demanded unnecessary information from the groups, the agreement in the washington case said. the irs expresses its sincere apology, it said. senior management within the irss exempt organizations division was delinquent in its responsibility to provide effective control, guidance, and direction over the processing of applications for tax exempt status filed by tea party and other political advocacy organizations, the settlement document said. a request to halt the other case, a class action suit involving 428 members, was filed in a federal court in ohio. republicans claimed the targeting of conservative groups showed political bias in the irs under former democratic president barack obama. house republican investigators found no connection to the obama administration, according to a 2014 report. but the report did blame irs officials for mistreating conservative organizations who sought taxexempt status and that irs officials covered up the misconduct and misled congress. the officials included former commissioner douglas shulman, former acting commissioner steven miller, and lois lerner, the former head of the unit overseeing applications for taxexempt status. obama fired miller after an internal 2013 irs audit released found poor management not partisan politics led to an inappropriate focus on conservative groups. no criminal charges were ever filed against irs officials. groups seeking tax exemption under federal law may engage in limited amounts of political activity, depending on the type of exemption sought. that and the vagueness of the rules often make it difficult for irs agents to tell which groups overstep and become ineligible for exemption.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "justice",

{"sample_id": 38, "text": "senators push wells fargo ceo on pay clawbacks after bogus accounts. reuters u.s. senate lawmakers excoriated wells fargo cos chief on tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened 2 million bogus customer accounts, potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are too big to fail. chief executive officer john stumpf told the senate banking committee on tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some democratic senators called for his resignation. under fire, stumpf said he has told his managers to do whatever it takes to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. but he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair. in answer to a question, he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing wells fargo. the consumer finance protection bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit classaction lawsuits. earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay 190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers knowledge. about 5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts. the revelations are a severe hit to wells fargos reputation. during the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted itself as conservative, in contrast to its rivals. besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives, wells fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance. the scandal also renewed debate over whether u.s. banks are too big to fail and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse. lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay, including clawbacks of compensation, and limits on forced arbitration. wells fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a nowretired executive at the center of the scandal, carrie tolstedt. democratic senators jeff merkley of oregon and elizabeth warren of massachusetts called for stumpf to resign, with warren saying stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated. you should resign. you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated, warren said. the banks board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives, stumpf told the committee. i accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices, stumpf said, adding later, i apologize to all of the american people and our customers, and i will make it right. lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings, increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan. new credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individuals credit. wells fargo has acknowledged bank employees inappropriately opened the customer accounts and that about 5,300 employees were fired over five years. former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer. abuses were found as early as 2011, stumpf said, but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year. at that time, stumpf said, managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees. it never dawned on us that there could be a cycle, the ceo said. it just sort of begs the issue of where was management, said senator sherrod brown of ohio, the senior democrat on the panel. brown said employees were caught forging signatures, and stealing identities, social security numbers, and customers hardearned cash, so as to hang on to their lowpaying jobs and make money for the highpaying executives at wells fargo. thomas curry, the comptroller of the currency, said the agency is considering action against individual wells fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations. the u.s. attorneys offices in manhattan and in san francisco are investigating wells fargo, a person familiar with the matter said last week. while democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks, republicans also grilled stumpf. louisiana senator david vitter pressed the ceo on how customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved. why isnt this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as wells is not only too big to fail but its too big to manage and too big to regulate? vitter asked. stumpf said the widespread abuse was a problem of focus and not of size. stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand. he suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren, according to the bank. wells fargo shares rose 2 percent to 46.94.", "tokens":

{"sample_id": 39, "text": "report toxic megyn kelly just got bad news from fox news after disastrous start at nbc. hello megyn kelly! time for a little karma! word on the street is that megyn kelly will not be welcomed back at fox news even if she comes crawling back from nbc.she s had a rocky start at nbc with her putin interview and now with the muchhyped alex jones interview. you d think the controversy surrounding her contentious interview with jones would pump up the ratings but it didn t. perhaps it s because she s become so unlikeable on camera with her snarky questioning and cold as ice demeanor.even if she comes calling at fox, it s a no go according to breitbart news after kelly s controversial and muchhyped interview with alex jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 minutes and america s funniest home videos, new york radio host mark simone tweeted on monday that nbc is trying to unload kelly and convince fox news to take her back.but a highranking fox news source told breitbart news that there is no way kelly could come back to the network. quite simply, the source told breitbart news, kelly would not be welcomed back. simone also suggested that if kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more, nbc will have to take her off the network, and if they are stuck with her, they ll give her an msnbc show. before she bolted to nbc, kelly anchored the kelly file on fox news. during the 2016 election cycle, kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut donald trump during the first republican presidential debate in august of 2015 in cleveland, ohio. she also gave never trumpers a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam trump throughout the election cycle.and as the daily beast s lloyd grove noted, kelly also hastened roger ailes forced resignation last july with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st century fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by fox news anchor gretchen carlson. new york magazine s gabriel sherman reported that kelly told investigators that ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at fox. as grove pointed out, kelly, in her book, said there was some poetic justice in the role she played in helping boot ailes out of fox news. i worked my tail off i established myself as a serious person, kelly wrote. i built my own power. and when the allegations against roger hit, i used it. perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. nbc reportedly invested nearly 20 million a year to bring kelly to the network, and nbc s investment has not paid any dividends at all. after her interview with russian president vladimir putin, kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. and when huffpost obtained the full unedited interview in which a nervous kelly lobbed putin softballs, kelly was subjected to another round of criticism.her interview with jones did not have any news value and may have damaged nbc s and her reputation more than it helped.you know what they say about karma it s a btch!read

{"sample_id": 40, "text": "trumps foundation openly admits to corruption, breaking irs rules. donald trump s lawbreaking is probably about to get a lot more blatant now that he s going to be in office. after all, he just told the nyt that presidents can t have conflicts of interest and has already used the office of the presidency for personal business. and as it has just been revealed, the trump foundation openly admits to corruption and breaking irs rules about selfdealing.in the 2015 tax return for the trump foundation, the organization indicates they transferred funds to a disqualified person in the last tax year trump, a member of his immediate family, or perhaps a business interest and also indicated they engaged in selfdealing in past years.from mother jonesdonald trump s charitable foundation has admitted to violating an irs ban selfdealing, the washington post reported on tuesday. the rules prohibit leaders of nonprofit organizations from using funds to benefit a disqualified person, which can include the presidentelect himself, members of his family, or their private business interests.the news comes just days after trump agreed to pay 25 million to settle several fraud lawsuits related to trump university.the foundation also indicated yes to a question regarding whether it had engaged in selfdealing in prior years. and yet conservatives think the clinton foundation was corrupt?the form doesn t give any specifics about what, exactly, the corrupt money flowing from the foundation to trump was spent on. however, we do know that in the past it s been spent on settling personal disputes, a tim tebow helmet, two paintings of himself, and settlement money. it s possible that the form was referring to any of those events, but it s also possible there is still more to uncover.many of the people who voted for trump will be the ones hurt by his administration, which is rapidly showing itself as a corrupt, quidproquo assortment of rich buddies

{"sample_id": 42, "text": "watch cvs employees hide in back room and call cops after black man tries to buy cheese. an africanamerican man made a late night trip with a friend to a cvs in carytown, virginia when he managed to do something so terrifying that it sent the staff scrambling to the back room while they waited for police to arrive he asked if they sold cheese. that particular cvs does not, in fact, sell cheese, but ricky berry who made the voyage de fromage with his roommate says that the staff disappeared after one of them explained that they don t sell sandwich cheese. we looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn t find anybody, berry s roommate said, adding that they had encountered another customer who wanted to buy orajel but could not find anyone to help. after a while, a police officer showed up and searched the store with the duo of cheeseloving men. he was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start. they found the employees cowering in the back room. the officer then made some calls and told them they would have to leave. we re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, berry said, he just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. we had no idea what was going on. the men were unsuccessful in their attempt to contact the store manager but did receive a fauxpology from cvs, who explained that the racist employee was being counseled and retrained rather than fired.watch a report on this latest example of

{"sample_id": 44, "text": "perus business community sours on kuczynski survey. paracas, peru reuters support from business leaders for peru s president pedro pablo kuczynski has plummeted, a survey showed, as he spars with an oppositioncontrolled congress and struggles to revive economic growth. the survey by ipsos peru, taken at a business forum in paracas to the south of lima last week and released late on friday, showed participants approval for kuczynski fell to 37 percent from 89 percent a year earlier at a similar event. kuczynski took office in july 2016 promising to modernize peru and strengthen its economy with solid backing from lima s business elite after a tight runoff election against rightwing populist keiko fujimori. but the 79yearold former investment banker s first year in power was hampered by congress, which is dominated by fujimori s popular force party and voted to oust his cabinet in september. meanwhile economic growth in what was once one of latin america s fastest growing economies slowed after heavy flooding and a corruption scandal involving brazilian builder odebrecht stalled investment in public works projects. the economy and politics cannot continue on separate lines, their progress is interdependent and deficiencies in politics and institutions can block the path of our development, the president of the business forum, drago kisic, told reporters. peru s central bank president julio velarde also warned during the event that the clashes between the government and congress could hinder growth in the future, saying the finance ministry had lost influence over the legislature. it is absolutely necessary in the long term that there be a better consensus among political forces in terms of agreeing on the essential elements to underpin growth, he said. finance minister claudia cooper said on friday peru s economy could grow more than 4 percent in 2018, up from 2.8 percent expected in 2017, if private investment in the metals exporting nation recovered. the ipsos survey showed that among hundreds attending peru s best known business forum, disapproval with kuczynski had risen to 63 percent from 11 percent a year earlier. closing the conference on friday, kuczynski defended his government and called on attendees and congress to unite in a fight against populism. i want to ask you to speak out more clearly about the challenges that we are facing politically, this is a determined government, not a confrontational one, he said.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "peru", "##s", "business", "community", "sour", "##s", "on", "ku",

{"sample_id": 45, "text": "vocal, powerful critic of wall street rules leaving congress. washington reuters representative jeb hensarling, the republican chairman of the u.s. house of representatives financial services committee, announced on tuesday that he would retire from congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of congresss leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. hensarling, 60, of texas, said in a statement that he would not seek reelection, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. he has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. today i am announcing that i will not seek reelection to the u.s. congress in 2018, hensarling said in a statement. although service in congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, i never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and i have already stayed far longer than i had originally planned. hensarling, first elected to congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 doddfrank financial reform law. the overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 20072009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. that bill, the financial choice act, is not expected to become law after passing the house, due to insufficient support in the senate. but his work was hailed by gop colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. jeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal doddfrank and deliver a freer market that gives every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream, said house majority leader kevin mccarthy in a statement. banking lobby groups, including the financial services roundtable and american bankers association, said hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. he has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. but those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put americans at risk of a similar meltdown. hensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. we hope the revolving door doesnt hit him too hard on the way out, said karl frisch, executive director of allied progress. while some gop lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill reelection battles, hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in texas where he remains highly popular. in 2016, he faced no republican rivals in the partys primary and took 80.6 percent of the districts vote in the general election. even though the district consistently votes republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the house in 2018. lawyer dan wood, has already entered the race to be the partys nominee for the seat. unlike some exiting republicans, hensarling never publicly feuded with president donald trump. in fact, trump had considered hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. his exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. representative patrick mchenry is the vice chair of the committee, but representatives blaine luetkemeyer, bill huizenga, and sean duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. one lobbyist said luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as mchenry is seen as a rising star in house leadership. luetkemeyer is seriously considering running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. hensarlings next move is unclear. some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the heritage foundation. alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. cowen and co analyst jaret seiberg said in a client note that hensarling could be the top contender to take over the federal housing finance agency, which regulates fannie mae and freddie mac. the current fhfa director, mel watt, is an appointee of former president barack obama, serving out a term that expires in january of 2019.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "vocal", ",", "powerful", "critic", "of", "wall", "street", "rules", "leaving", "congress", ".",

to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers. lynch s statement about the founding fathers is quite ironic, considering that she worked handinhand with former president barack obama to destroy the very fabric of our constitution. it has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came

{"sample_id": 48, "text": "breaking aclj files lawsuit against obamas corrupt attorney general for secret bill clinton meeting on plane during hillary investigation video. are the most criminal, brazen and crooked group of people to ever act as public servants in our government watching their house of cards fall? i told you about the obama justice department s incompetence and corruption when, over four months ago, i called for attorney general loretta lynch s resignation.remember when attorney general loretta lynch and the husband of the former secretary of state met on a plane on the tarmaci told you about general lynch s decision to hold a secret meeting on her airplane with former president bill clinton just days before the fbi interviewed his wife, the former secretary of state, as part of a criminal investigation and just days before general lynch announced the former secretary of state would not be indicted. here s what i said in junemisconduct. dishonesty. impropriety. no matter what word you choose, attorney general lynch s secret meeting with former president bill clinton was flatout wrong. she s clearly disqualified from participating in the investigations into former secretary of state clinton s private email server.and she must resign.i m leading our senior litigation team preparing to file legal demands and ethics complaints. if the doj doesn t respond and she doesn t resign, we ll be back in federal court. as promised, we took action. we sent freedom of information act foia requests to the obama justice department and the fbi, demanding answers on how such a careless and perhaps intentionally underhanded meeting was allowed to happen.the fbi acknowledged our foia requests, and even granted our request for expedited processing by determining that we had shown our requests concerned a matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government s integrity which affect public confidence. the justice department remained silent.then, last week s earthshattering news hit that the fbi a component of the justice department was reopening the underlying criminal investigation.and early this week, the fbi advised the aclj government accountability project that no records responsive to your request were located. hard to believe. what may be even harder to believe, though, is the fact that the department of justice completely ignored our lawful requests for records. or maybe that s just par for the course.so today, we re forcing their hand. we re taking the obama administration to federal court. again. we re filing a lawsuit against the department of justice, to ensure true justice. if the corruption and flippant disregard for the law won t stop, neither will our government accountability project, and neither will our lawsuits.as we explained in our complaint, we re demanding records like thisany and all records containing the names of any doj official, staff or employee who participated in any discussion regarding the meeting between general lynch and bill clinton that occurred on monday, june 27, 2016, at sky harbor international airport in phoenix, arizona.any and all records, communications or briefings prepared, sent, received or reviewed by general lynch or any other doj official, staff or employee, at any time, containing any

party who used paid plants to incite violence at trump rallies. o keefe was also able to tie barack obama directly to their chief organizer. of course, every major fakenews outlet completely ignored these horrific coordinated acts of violence against innocent americans.over the past several months, o keefe has been releasing undercover videos he s used to expose the bias and unprofessional tactics used by news publications like the new york times and now, the washington post.today, the washington post attempted to embarrass o keefe for allegedly setting a trap for them with a woman

{"sample_id": 50, "text": "this is what real christians do when their priest preaches to ban abortion video. the members of a roman catholic church in poland have demonstrated to the world how compassionate christians can shut down priest when they preach politics, not religion, from the pulpit.the women were at a roman catholic church in gdansk, which is spearheading the outlawing of abortion in the eastern european country. the priest began reading a letter to the congregation in favor of the ban, which triggered a large number of mostly female worshippers to stand, turn their back on the priest, and leave the church.as the journal reportsthe message from poland s catholic bishops, presented at churches nationwide, called on lawmakers to back the proposal being considered by poland s rightwing government.the move would tighten what are already some of europe s most restrictive laws on pregnancy termination. current legislation, dating from 1993, already bans all terminations except when pregnancy results from rape or incest, poses a health risk to the mother, or if the foetus is severely deformed.prolife activists support even tougher legislation but the move has sparked a backlash and thousands of marchers took part in a protest outside the country s parliament in warsaw yesterday, as well as in several other cities.the move is in sharp contrast to christian conservatives in the united states, who are actually rallying behind candidates and religious leaders who wear their prejudice and intolerance on their sleeve. even pope francis is being pilloried by the christian right in america for his refusal to hate and preach against muslims.in fact, there is not a candidate left in the gop race for president who believes in a woman s reproductive rights over her own body. donald trump believes women should be punished for having abortions. ted cruz would outlaw abortion, with no exceptions even in cases of incest or rape. even the candidate who is selling himself as the moderate, john kasich, also calls for a total ban on abortion. there is no prochoice version of the republican message anymore.in economic policy, the ultraright of the conservative movement has killed off the eisenhower republicans the gop lawmakers and voters who believed in investment, taxation and welfare as the pillars which support free enterprise and a stable, prosperous society. at the same time, the evangelists have killed any hope of social liberalism in the party.what s left behind is a cold, cruel, and crazy mob, who simply do not care about facts, evidence or rational discussion. they are zealots. let us hope that for the sake of the republican party, and the country, that a complete slaughtering in election 2016 brings everyone back to their senses. image via screengrab", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "this", "is", "what", "real", "christians", "do", "when", "their", "priest", "preach", "##es", "to", "ban", "abortion",

{"sample_id": 51, "text": "u.s. chief justice uses sign language as deaf lawyers sworn in. washington reuters in an historic first, u.s. chief justice john roberts used sign language from the supreme court bench on tuesday as he welcomed a dozen deaf and hardofhearing lawyers who took part in a ceremony authorizing them to argue cases before the court. the 12 members of deaf and hard of hearing bar association were sworn in as members of the supreme court bar. after they were presented to the court for admission, roberts signed in american sign language your motion is granted.membership in the supreme court bar allows a lawyer to argue cases before the justices but most of its members never actually do so. roberts, appointed by republican president george w. bush in 2005, is believed to be the first u.s. chief justice to use sign language from the bench. it was also the first time members of the deaf and hard of hearing bar association took part in a swearingin ceremony at the court. the lawyers then stayed for oral arguments in two cases in the ornate courtroom, assisted by an interpreter standing in front of the mahogany bench where the eight justices sit. the lawyers were permitted to use an instant transcription service that was transmitted to electronic devices. normally, no electronic devices are allowed in the courtroom. one of the attorneys, teresa curtin of the weitz luxenberg law firm, said in a statement the event was aimed at encouraging more people with disabilities to embark on legal careers. when she began her law career in the late 1980s, there was only a handful of deaf lawyers in the united states, while now there are around 250, curtin said. in 1982, a deaf lawyer, michael chatoff, argued a case before the supreme court, assisted by a realtime transcription system. that case concerned whether a school board was required to provide a deaf student with a signlanguage interpreter. chatoff lost the case in a 63 ruling.", "tokens":

{"sample_id": 55, "text": "finnish police rap deputy minister for hiding in car boot in government crisis. helsinki reuters finnish police reprimanded a man for traveling in a car boot to hide his meeting with prime minister juha sipila during a government crisis last summer, saying this was breach of the traffic code. a police statement did not name the man in the boot, but in effect indicated the traveler was state secretary samuli virtanen, who is also the deputy to foreign minister timo soini. the meeting took place in june, a day after virtanen s coruling finns party had elected antiimmigration hardliners as its new leaders. the government was close to collapse until a group of politicians, including virtanen and soini, in the following week walked out of the finns party and announced they would form a new group. the finns party was thrown out of the government and the new blue reform group kept its cabinet seat. virtanen has not commented on the case, but lawmaker tiina elovaara from blue reform said in a blog that virtanen climbed into the boot to keep the meeting secret at a critical moment. he avoided media attention when the situation was most serious, and the risk of leakage about the parliamentarians transition was too big, elovaara said. police said that the man had traveled a few tens of meters in the back of the car, failing to use a safety belt. he had admitted the act to the police. the road from the prime minister s residency has little traffic, and only the man was at risk of harm, the police said. the given notification is considered as a sufficient sanction, inspector pekka seppala said. he added that the police had been asked to investigate the case based on information in media reports.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "finnish", "police",

{"sample_id": 56, "text": "u.s. lawmaker requests investigation into threat to alaska senators over healthcare vote. washington reuters a leading democratic lawmaker on thursday said he would ask federal officials to investigate reported threats by interior secretary ryan zinke regarding alaska energy policy to retaliate against opposition from one of the states republican senators to efforts to repeal obamacare. u.s. representative raul grijalva of arizona, the top democrat on the house of representatives committee on natural resources, said an investigation is necessary and called zinkes actions unethical. the congressman will ask the government accountability office, the interior departments inspector general or both to investigate, a spokesman said. the alaska dispatch news on thursday reported that zinke had called senators lisa murkowski and dan sullivan, both republicans, on wednesday. he warned them that murkowskis vote on tuesday against a motion to begin debate on the healthcare overhaul could have negative consequences for energy and land use in alaska, the newspaper said. murkowskis no vote forced vice president mike pence to cast a tiebreaking vote to pass the motion by a 5150 ballot. the call from zinke followed a phone conversation murkowski had with republican president donald trump on tuesday, which she described to ee news, an energy and environment publication, as very unpleasant. murkowski spokeswoman karina petersen confirmed that zinke had called the senator. threatening to punish your rivals as political blackmail is something wed see from the kremlin, grijalva said. secretary zinkes willingness to deliver these threats speaks volumes about his ethical standards and demonstrates that interiors policy positions are up for political grabs, rather than based on science or the public interest. zinkes office did not respond to requests for comment. his interior department oversees more than 20 percent of federal land, including national parks such as yosemite, and deals with energy development on public land and offshore areas. the department deals with policies crucial to alaskas economy such as oil drilling and control of wildlife areas. until he became a cabinet member earlier this year, he was himself a u.s. congressman, representing montana. murkowski, as chair of the senate committee on energy and natural resources, oversees appropriations and appointee confirmations for the interior department. separately, interior department watchdog group the western values project filed a records request related to zinkes calls to murkowski and sullivan.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "u", ".", "s", ".", "law", "##maker", "requests", "investigation", "into", "threat", "to", "alaska", "senators", "over", "healthcare",

{"sample_id": 57, "text": "watch trump embarrasses america by throwing temper tantrum in front of nato leaders. just remember this the next time we need help from our allies and they tell us to go fck ourselves.donald trump has been on a whirlwind foreign trip in which he has been embarrassing the red, white, and blue in every nation he has visited.first, he bowed like a princess before the saudi king and even went full hypocrite by refusing to say radical islam during his speech there.then he went to israel and confirmed that the israelis were the source of the highly classified intelligence he leaked to the russians.on thursday, trump delivered a speech in front of nato leaders and insulted our allies.the whiny temper tantrum was all about trump s complaint that some nato nations have not paid enough for their own defense. i have been very, very direct with secretary stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that nato members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations. but 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they re supposed to be paying for their defense. this is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the united states, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years. trump s speech may have gone down well with his conservative supporters in redneckistan usa, but our allies were sure as hell pissed off. the looks on their faces as trump bitched about them spoke volumes.here s the video via youtubethis was supposed to be a speech to unite europe and the united states against terrorism. but what trump did is divisive and totally counterproductive. it s also hypocritical considering how much money the united states owes to other nations. and, that s not how nato works.angering our allies won t help us win the war against terrorism. if anything, it only lets terrorists know that they are succeeding.furthermore, while trump was busy humiliating himself and our country, he failed to throw his support behind article 5, a crucial part of the military alliance with the other nato members that says all members will come to defense of any nato member that comes under attack. in other words, if russia attacked france tomorrow every nato nation would be obligated to come to france s defense. but apparently, trump didn t want to do anything to make vladimir putin angry. trump s silence on article 5 suggests that he would not come to the defense of any of our allies if they were to be attacked.once again, trump proves to be an embarrassment who has turned america into a laughingstock around the globe.featured image screenshot", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "watch", "trump", "em",

{"sample_id": 58, "text": "trump says hes likely to sign healthcare order this week. washington reuters president donald trump said on tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow americans to buy strippeddown health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the obamacare law that trump opposes. unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a congress led by his own party, trump indicated he would take unilateral action. he offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain great, competitive healthcare costing the united states nothing. the expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements. these include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment. it would also expand the amount of time people can use shortterm medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. people could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law. ill also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare, trump told reporters in the oval office. with congress the way it is, i decided to take it upon myself, trump added, saying the plan is largely worked out. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will make his announcement by the end of friday. trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. the association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. it is unclear when these plans would become available. it is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins nov. 1. experts questioned trumps authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare. the plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 affordable care act, dubbed obamacare. that could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the trump administration. experts said trumps plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the laws protection that people with preexisting medical conditions cannot be charged more. theres a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets, said craig garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management, referring to the trump administration. it unwinds the ability of people with preexisting conditions to get insurance under the aca, garthwaite said. republicans have failed to make good on their sevenyear promise to repeal and replace obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of trumps democratic predecessor barack obama. gutting obamacare was a top trump campaign promise. trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it implode, has undermined obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. last week, the u.s. department of health and human services issued a rule that will let businesses and nonprofit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the laws mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no copayment. trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under obamacare. the payments are estimated to be about 7 billion this year and help lower outofpocket medical costs for lowincome consumers. insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums. his administration has slashed the obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "trump", "says",

before.it turns out that former president barack obama s press secretary, josh earnest, just got a new job and it s definitely going to piss the entire trump administration off. while most americans miss seeing earnest s press briefings especially because he s been replaced by pathetic sean spicer we will now be able to see him speak regularly as a political contributor for nbc news and msnbc!nbc news president noah oppenheim and msnbc president phil griffin made this announcement on monday, and it s clear that they couldn t be happier with earnest joining the team, considering his extensive political experience under obama. the memo they circulated this morning said we are pleased to announce that josh earnest will join nbc news and msnbc as a political analyst. as you may have seen, he made his debut this morning on today and morning joe. josh recently completed a tenyear run with president obama, most recently serving as white house press secretary from 20142017.josh joined the obama presidential campaign in march 2007 as the iowa communications director, and went on to serve as deputy communications director during the 2008 general election. josh has also worked on numerous national, statewide and local campaigns over the course of his twenty years in politics. as expected, earnest s debut was nothing but epic, and it s just what we would expect from the former press secretary after working closely with obama for so many years. earnest marked his first day in his new role in nbc s today, where he didn t hesitate to talk about what a massive failure trump was and how pathetic the gop s plan to repeal and replace obamacare was.you can watch earnest s debut herefeatured image via gage skidmore flickr", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "obama", "##s", "press", "secretary",

catalan crisis and stressed her support for the unity of spain while encouraging more dialogue, her spokesman said on monday. merkel also discussed the catalan situation with european commission president jeanclaude juncker on saturday. she spoke with both about the current situation in spain and, in the talks with prime minister rajoy in particular, she affirmed her support for the unity of spain, the german government spokesman told a regular news conference. merkel also discussed ways to strengthen internal dialogue within spain as far as the constitution allows, he said. concern is mounting in europe over a possible declaration of independence by the catalan regional parliament and the reaction of the spanish government, which could exacerbate what is already spain s worst political crisis for decades. merkel will host european council president donald tusk for informal talks in berlin on wednesday, her spokesman said, but declined to speculate whether they would discuss the catalan crisis.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "mer", "##kel", "tells", "raj", "##oy", "of", "support", "for", "unity", "of", "spain", ".", "berlin", "reuters", "german", "chancellor", "angela",

{"sample_id": 63, "text": "experts militiamen live hand to mouth on govt disability and their wives hard work. jon ritzheimer, infamous rightwing terrorist and incredible douchebag, barely squeaks by on his government disability check and has said that he is thankful to have a wife who works. as it turns out, experts tell us that this guy who spends his days fighting imaginary battles and sucking up a good man s oxygen isn t the exception to the demographics that make up a rightwing terrorist militia, he s the definition. these guys are broke, said mark pitcavage, who has been researching farright movements for 22 years and has studied the harney county occupiers. rightwing extremists, generally speaking, have very little money. how a rightwing extremist occupation like the one in oregon would pay for itself isn t exactly an issue there s been a lot of data on. by referencing the research of people like pitcavage, we can deduce that rightwing extremists are for the most part freeloaders, likened to teenagers who think they can take care of themselves but overwhelmed the first time they have to pay a bill or do a load of laundry. it s quite possible that a lot of them will get tired and feel the pressure to go back and care for their families, pitcavage explained. those families, left behind to care for themselves, are probably better off without their patriarch, the almighty man who controls everything and can make the decision to just pack up and leave on a whim to occupy a forest a thousand miles away that they ve never heard of before last week.daryl johnson, a former dhs domestic terrorism analyst, says militia members have a warped sense of priority where their duty is concerned. a video released by ritzheimer showed him crying that he would probably be killed and how much he would miss his family just before he held up a copy of the constitution and declared but i took an oath. they ll think nothing about taking half their paycheck and using half of it to buy ammunition and guns, johnson told the oregonian.the gist here is that these idiots aren t just the worst the american gene pool has to offer, they re also incredible assholes who are neglecting their families to go play soldier in the oregon wilderness. they re holed up in a facility they didn t pay to be at, squeezing the taxpayer for their utilities and costing tens if not hundreds of thousands more in wages paid to employees who can t go to work.the sooner these imbeciles are removed and incarcerated the better off the country and their families will be.featured image

{"sample_id": 64, "text": "hannity defends trump with psychotic threat to morning joe, this could ruin him tweet. one of donald trump s biggest fans, fox news host sean hannity, has just tried to come to his rescue after the potus was condemned for his disgusting attack on morning joe hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski.on saturday, as trump himself was having a meltdown on twitter, hannity decided to join the chaos by defending trump and his petty, nasty attacks on the morning joe hosts. in a disgusting attempt to kiss trump s ss, hannity made an insane threat to the msnbc news couple, hinting that he had some incriminating dirt on the morning joe hosts.no one really knows what the hell going there actually means, but he s likely trying to channel trump in his ominous threat and if he s really trying to emulate trump, we can bet that he s bluffing.hannity has a history of going after scarborough, having previously claimed that scarborough has many skeletons in his closet office. when hannity had made those statements, he was referring to an incident in which a dead intern was found in scarborough s district office during his time as a congressman in 2001. while scarborough had nothing to do with the intern s death, he resigned from his position due to the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. coincidentally, trump also loves conspiracy theories.while we re not aware of what other nonsense hannity might want to spread about scarborough and brzezinski, is certainly a shame that he s threatening the couple just because they re speaking out against trump.hannity s cryptic tweet proves that fox news and its reporters will do anything to defend trump, no matter how bad it makes them look. just last month, hannity said he would be willing to pay for therapy for the morning joe hosts because he felt they d become unhinged. clearly, it s the other way around.featured image is a screenshot", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "han", "##nity", "defend", "##s",

{"sample_id": 65, "text": "bosnian experts find 86 skulls at scene of 90s war massacre. sarajevo reuters forensic experts have found 86 skulls in a mass grave near the scene of a massacre of bosnian muslims and croats by serb forces early in the 199295 war, officials said on friday. the skulls and more than 50 other body parts were found covered with rocks in a remote spot near a ravine in central bosnia, the country s missing persons institute said. experts began searching on sept 7, hours after the bosnian war crimes court ordered the exhumations at mount vlasic. at the time, the teams said they were only expecting to find the remains of around 60 people. on aug. 21, 1992, bosnian serbs told prisoners from detention camps for nonserbs near the town of prijedor that they would be released in a prisoner exchange. but instead they drove them away by bus, lined them up by the edge of a ravine and shot them. only a dozen survived what has become known as the koricani cliffs massacre, by tumbling or jumping down the steep ravine. the 199295 war claimed 100,000 lives. the killings were part of a wave of ethnic cleansing by bosnian serb forces who were trying to create a serb statelet by removing bosniaks bosnian muslims and croats from the area. forensic experts have already identified 117 victims of the massacre in several other mass grave sites. we hope that the search for the victims of this massacre has completed today, said lejla cengic from the missing persons institute. eleven bosnian serb expolicemen were convicted for the ravine killings, including darko mrdja who was jailed for 17 years by the haguebased u.n. war crimes court. the remainder were convicted by the bosnian war crimes court.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "bosnian", "experts", "find", "86",

{"sample_id": 68, "text": "trump explodes in twitter tantrum that proves hes mentally unfit to be president. donald trump threw a massive hissy fit over just about everything on tuesday morning.some things just do not need to be commented on by the president, but for some reason, trump thinks he needs to comment on everything.in a series of whining tweets, trump took petty shots at democrats, espn, jemele hill, the nfl, and senator bob corker that perfectly demonstrate how thinskinned and how pathetically unfit he is to be president.he began by threatening the nfl for not punishing players who exercise their right to free speech.why is the nfl getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our anthem, flag and country? change tax law! donald j. trump october 10, 2017then he bitched about democrats for not supporting his useless and expensive border wall.the problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the democrats don t want secure borders,they don t care about safety for u.s.a. donald j. trump october 10, 2017trump then declared that he would destroy healthcare by executive order.since congress can t get its act together on healthcare, i will be using the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people fast donald j. trump october 10, 2017trump also attacked jemele hill for rightfully calling for a boycott of the dallas cowboys.with jemele hill at the mike, it is no wonder espn ratings have tanked, in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry! donald j. trump october 10, 2017hill posted her tweets in response to cowboys owner jerry jones threatening to punish any player who kneels during the national anthem. by issuing such a threat, america s team clearly does not support america s constitution.to cap it all off, trump attacked the new york times and insulted senator bob corker.the failing nytimes set liddle bob corker up by recording his conversation. was made to sound a fool, and that s what i am dealing with! donald j. trump october 10, 2017seriously, does trump have nothing better to do? you know, like actually doing his job?featured image spencer plattgetty images",

{"sample_id": 69, "text": "british aid minister patel resigns in new test for pm may. london reuters british aid minister priti patel was forced from office on wednesday over undisclosed meetings with israeli officials after prime minister theresa may sought to reassert her diminished authority as she negotiates brexit. patel, a brexit campaigner who is popular in the ruling conservative party, had to abandon a trip to africa earlier on wednesday after being summoned by may to answer questions on more unsanctioned meetings that breached diplomatic protocol. after a hastily arranged meeting not long after patel landed in london, may s office released her minister s letter of resignation, in which patel said her conduct in israel had fallen below the high standards required of her post. while my actions were meant with the best of intentions, my actions also fell below the standards of transparency and openness that i have promoted and advocated, patel wrote in the letter to may. i offer a fulsome apology to you and to the government for what has happened and offer my resignation. may responded in a letter, saying now that further details have come to light, it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated. it was not clear who would replace patel, who held the meetings during a holiday in israel earlier this year. under british protocol, a cabinet minister would normally organize meetings through the foreign office and be accompanied by officials, and visits with israelis would typically be balanced with meetings with palestinians. it is the second resignation in may s top team in a week, underlining her weakness at a time when she faces the complicated task of unravelling more than 40 years of ties with the european union and holding a deeply divided party together. patel s meetings with israeli officials, which may s office said they were not aware of, and a reported visit to an israeli army field hospital in the golan heights, have increased the pressure on the prime minister, who depends on a northern irish party in parliament to pass legislation. but while acting quickly to force patel to resign, the loss of an enthusiastic brexit campaigner from her cabinet team of top ministers could mean that may faces greater pressure from lawmakers to pursue a clean break from the eu. priti is more popular than theresa, and has more contacts and influence overseas, a senior conservative source said. if i was may, i wouldn t want priti unleashed on the back benches, the source said, using a term to describe lawmakers. patel was sacked a week after may s ally michael fallon, her defense secretary, resigned in a sexual harassment scandal that was also caught up two other ministers, including her deputy, damian green. in a week of crises, her foreign minister, boris johnson, on tuesday was pressed to apologize over remarks he made about a jailed aid worker in iran, which critics said could prompt the islamic republic to hand her a longer jail term. with brexit talks all but hamstrung over how much britain should pay to leave the european union, opposition lawmakers and other critics are now openly questioning whether may can continue as prime minister. there are times when a government has the stench of death about it, pat mcfadden, a lawmaker from the main opposition labour party, told parliament on tuesday.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "british", "aid", "minister", "patel", "resign", "##s", "in", "new", "test", "for", "pm", "may", ".", "london",

{"sample_id": 71, "text": "malia obama is getting political and standing up against trump. less than a week after her father left office on a nearly historically high approval rating, first daughter malia obama is dipping her hat into politics, sort of.according to the former president, both his daughters were disappointed that donald trump won, but they are both still hopeful. malia is taking that hope and standing up for the native americans at standing rock.malia, who s now 18, skipped a wellearned post presidential family vacation and opted instead to go to the sundance film festival. it was there, in park city, utah, where malia joined a protest against trump and against the oil companies insisting on putting a pipeline through sacred land.and this past monday, just four days after her father vacated the oval office, malia made it clear just how disappointed she was in the new commanderinchief by joining a rally protesting his plans to revive the dakota access pipeline project.the 18yearold student, who will be heading off to harvard university later this year, was one of approximately 100 people who gathered on main street at the sundance film festival to let it be known how upset she was with president trump s plan to move forward with the controversial transport system.the group braved the blistering cold and heavy snowfall as they held up signs reading exist. resist. rise. and impeach corporate control. source daily maillast month, members of the standing rock sioux nation were celebrating after the united states army announced they would not approve the easement for the pipeline s construction. this was after months of protests.in his first week in office, donald trump reversed that decision and chose to screw the standing rock sioux by signing an executive order that would allow the pipeline to go forward. that s what malia is protesting. look for this to be the first in a brilliant young woman s life as an activist, if not a politician.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "mali", "##a", "obama", "is", "getting", "political", "and", "standing", "up", "against", "trump", ".", "less",

sturgeon said, speaking as her scottish national party snp began a threeday conference in glasgow. people watch the chaos that is engulfing the uk right now and people look ahead and see the damage

still has a choice over the shape of its future trading relations, sturgeon argued. i believe so, so strongly, not for ideological reasons but for hard practical reasons, it would be an act of

{"sample_id": 73, "text": "breaking picture of mother whose boy climbed into gorilla cage is revealedangry black twitter users humiliated after blaming white privilege for gorillas death. here s what some ignorant race baiting twitter users had to say about the recent tragedy that involved the killing of a silverback gorilla, after a 4 year old boy fell into the exhibit in the cincinnati zoo. one of the users claimed the white boy who was only saved because he was white. meanwhile, one of these fools actually said if the boy was black the endangered gorilla would have only been tranquilized. lol!tweets are courtesy of breitbart newsthere are so many things we could point out that are wrong with these ignorant tweets, but clearly the most stinging mistake was the accusations being made about the skin color of the boy.here s a picture the mother of the 4yearold boy who fell into the gorilla world exhibit at the cincinnati zoo, which lead to the fatal shooting of harambe the gorilla. she has been identified as michelle gregg. she is clearly not suffering from white privilege lol!the 32yearold mom of four and cincinnati resident posted a nowdeleted facebook post thanking the zoo for making the difficult decision to shoot the gorilla to save her son.here is her facebook post explaining the incidentharambe, a 17yearold western lowland silverback gorilla, was killed after dragging the boy through a moat inside the exhibit.watch video here the zoo security team s quick response saved the child s life. we are all devastated that this tragic accident resulted in the death of a criticallyendangered gorilla, zoo director thane maynard said in a statement. this is a huge loss for the zoo family and the gorilla population worldwide. videos of the incident were recorded by a bystander and posted on social media. the videos show the 400pound gorilla grabbing the 4yearold boy and dragging him through a moat area. he then stops and stands over the boy, before dragging him further into the enclosure.during one part of the video, which you can watch below, michelle gregg can be heard talking to her crying son and saying oh god, please protect him, while panicked zoo visitors call for help. isaiah, be calm, gregg calls out. be calm, be calm. in another part of the video, she can be heard saying, mommy s right here, and mommy loves you. kim o connor, who recorded video of the incident, said it appeared the gorilla was trying to protect the child. i don t know if the screaming did it or too many people hanging on the edge, if he thought we were coming in, but then he pulled the boy down away further from the big group, kim o connor told wlwttv.cincinnati fire chief marc monahan said in a statement to nbc news that the gorilla was seen violently dragging and throwing the child. he said the gorilla was neutralized by a cincinnati zoo employee with one shot from a long rifle.the family issued this statement through a pr firm we are so thankful to the lord that our child is safe. he is home and doing just fine. we extend our heartfelt thanks for the quick action by the cincinnati zoo staff, the statement from gail myers public relations said. we know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla. we hope that you will respect our privacy at this time. the 4yearold boy was released from a local children s hospital on sunday. he suffered serious, but not lifethreatening, injuries, authorities said. via heavy", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "breaking", "picture", "of", "mother", "whose", "boy",

{"sample_id": 74, "text": "trump threat to renegotiate u.n. climate deal causes dismay abroad. oslowashington reuters donald trumps vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected u.s. president caused dismay abroad on wednesday, with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels. u.s. insistence on renegotiation could unravel a 195nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in paris in december after fraught talks between nations as different as china, the united states, small island states and opec members. the paris agreement is as much in the united states interests as any other country, said tony de brum, ambassador for climate change of the marshall islands who, as his countrys foreign minister, helped broker the u.n. deal. seeking to unravel it would not only threaten the u.s. economy, damage its environment, and weaken its security, but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity, he said. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, told reuters on tuesday he was not a big fan of the climate accord. he said china and other countries would not stick to the onesided deal, which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming. i will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum i will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. and at a maximum i may do something else, he said. trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by china to hurt the competitiveness of u.s. business. government officials meeting in bonn, germany, from may 1626 to find ways to implement the deal, raised concerns about trumps comments but doubted he would take serious action. thats because the deal imposes no real constraints on the united states it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change. president barack obama has promised to cut emissions by 2025, but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply, meaning little incentive to challenge the u.n. deal. many officials also say it is in u.s. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution, a big cause of disease. even many nations traditionally sceptical that manmade greenhouse emissions stoke climate change, like opec countries, have gone along with the paris agreement. george david banks, a senior climate change adviser to president george w. bush and a trump supporter, said trump could try to force countries like china to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement. thats wishful thinking, according to john coequyt, director of green group the sierra clubs international climate campaigns. you cant get more than 190 countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing, he said. the paris agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. china and the united states, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. if the deal enters into force before the next u.s. president takes office next year, it will in theory be harder to pull out. article 28 says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force the length of a u.s. presidential term. trumps easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected, legal experts say. trump could ignore the targets set by obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming. the paris agreements flexible approach, allowing all to set their own goals, is radically different from the u.n.s 1997 kyoto protocol, which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until 2012. the united states did not take part in kyoto president george w. bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that, he said, unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by china and india. former french foreign minister laurent fabius, who helped broker the paris deal, said this month that the u.s. election was critical to its future. if a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption, he said. but u.s. chief climate envoy jonathan pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the paris agreement whoever wins the white house.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "trump", "threat", "to", "rene", "##go", "##tia", "##te", "u",

{"sample_id": 75, "text": "watch trump doesnt want us to remember what he said about russia in 2014. as time goes on, it becomes ever clearer that trump is russia s puppet. there s every possibility he owes them money, and he s repeatedly blasted our intelligence community for daring to say that russia did, indeed, engage in a concerted campaign to influence our election in trump s favor. but did he always feel this way? was he always russia s puppet?it seems not, and it s by his own words that we know this. as recently as 2014, he said, in a series of interviews, that mitt romney was right to say that russia was our greatest geopolitical foe mitt said russia is a hell of a problem, and everybody laughed at him, including certain media, by the way. they laughed. it turned out that he s absolutely right. you look at what russia s doing with iran, how they controlled the situation, and syria, and virtually every other place. he also insinuated that obama was putin s puppet because he felt we being meek and cowardly in the face of such a threat. we should definitely be strong, we should definitely do sanctions, and we have to show some strength. i mean, putin has eaten obama s lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time. now he says he s open to lifting our sanctions on russia if we can all just get along, which is never going to happen because russia is ruled by an autocrat. if we lift the sanctions, russia will pull trump s puppet strings even more. he also seems to like to kiss putin s ass, mouth, and dick he doesn t criticize russia at all, and staunchly defends them against other criticisms and revelations.here s his stance back in 2014in other words, this is another position on which he s flipflopped. he just says whatever his strongest manhandlers want him to say. whether they re his supporters, or foreign powers hoping to use him for their own gain, he says whatever he thinks will win him the most points.featured image by spencer platt via

could not be more different. george w. bush is a natural born leader. he inspires others to consider someone other than themselves, to come together and to unite. he proves through his actions that we shouldn t be afraid to act as a humble servant of the lord. barack obama s speech on the other hand, proves he is nothing more than a narcissistic, arrogant and condescending community agitator. as george w. bush appeals to the better side of america and implores them to come together and heal in the face of heightened racial tensions, obama remains laser focused on himself, and on his insatiable desire to take away our second amendment right. obama s speech was not geared towards healing a torn and divided community. his speech was about promoting his radical guncontrol agenda. it was about sound bites, as he waited on cue for applause from a group of people who were there to mourn the loss of their father, their brother, their son or their trusted coworker.watch george w. bush

{"sample_id": 77, "text": "obama says journalists partly to blame for tone of presidential race. washington reuters president barack obama on monday laid some of the blame for the tone of the presidential campaign on political journalism that has been pinched by shrinking newsroom budgets and cheapened by a focus on retweets and likes on social media. in a speech to a journalism awards dinner, obama urged journalists to ask tougher questions of the candidates vying to be president. he voiced dismay over the vulgar rhetoric, violence at rallies and unrealistic campaign pledges that have continually grabbed headlines, in a thinly veiled reference to republican frontrunner donald trump. the number one question im getting as i travel around the world or talk to world leaders right now is, what is happening in america? about our politics, obama said, describing international alarm over whether the united states will continue to function effectively. its not because around the world people have not seen crazy politics. it is that they understand america is the place where you cant afford completely crazy politics, he said. when our elected officials and our political campaigns become entirely untethered to reason and facts and analysis, when it doesnt matter whats true and whats not, that makes it all but impossible for us to make good decisions on behalf of future generations, obama said. he said the media landscape has changed since his first presidential campaign in 2008, when there was a price if you said one thing and then did something completely different. the question is, in the current media environment, is that still true? does that still hold? he said. he said news organizations have a responsibility to dig deeper despite the faster pace of this smartphone age and steep financial pressures in the news business. voters would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they cant keep, obama said. the new york times earlier this month reported that trump has so far earned almost 1.9 billion worth of media coverage, compared with 313 million for the next closest republican challenger, u.s. senator ted cruz of texas, and 746 million for democratic frontrunner hillary clinton.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "obama", "says",

{"sample_id": 78, "text": "hong kong soccer fans defy beijing by booing chinese national anthem. hong kong reuters hundreds of hong kong soccer fans booed and jeered the chinese national anthem at an asia cup qualifier match on tuesday in defiance of communist party rulers in beijing. the booing of the anthem, the march of the volunteers , has become a fixture at football matches in the chineseruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the united states where american football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by u.s. president donald trump. now the former british colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to china 20 years ago. details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. china extended the law to cover hong kong earlier this month. chinese president xi jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech. chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state. several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said die for hong kong , while others yelled we are hong kong in english, rather than the local cantonese dialect. some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave. i m not scared even if it becomes law ... i will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on, hong kong supporter bendter chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted. tensions between hong kong and mainland china have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from beijing. most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship. security was tight at the hong kong stadium, the venue for the city s annual rugby sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. the stadium has capacity for 40,000. the game ended lebanon 1, hong kong 0. i m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved, said hong kong supporter fai chan. but it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect. hong kong returned from british to chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression. in 2015, hong kong football fans booed the chinese anthem during a world cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the hong kong football association from world body fifa. the association was warned by the asian football confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment .",

{"sample_id": 79, "text": "what this georgia republican just said about the kkk, slavery and isis will blow your mind. a state republican in georgia made an astonishingly racist set of remarks, in his defense of the south s confederate and racist history.state rep. tommy benton has flatout denied that the civil war had anything to do with slavery, compared the confederate leaders to the founding fathers, expressed his profound displeasure with what he called cultural cleansing of southern history. he insisted that the kkk was not a racist organization but rather a vigilante thing to help keep law and order, claiming that made a lot of people straighten up. where do we even begin here? let s start with the assertion that the civil war had nothing to do with slavery. we can refer to the cornerstone speech, which was given by vice president alexander stephens of the confederacy, a few weeks before the confederacy started the civil war.our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition.he suggested that the civil war was wrong because the north didn t address the loss of what was approximately two billion dollars worth of property that belonged to the south. yes, he meant that the slaves were the property of the south.benton also is critical of africanamericans for not denouncing their own african ancestors for selling slaves.then comes the idea of cultural cleansing. the offensiveness of this kind of assertion is profound. cultural cleansing is another term for genocide, the latter of which didn t exist as a word until the nazi s tried to cleanse europe of people they considered to be undesirables. no, the removal of a confederate flag is not equal to the gassing of the jews in nazi germany.benton expanded on the cleansing remarks by saying that the removal of things like the confederate flag or renaming of things like streets or buildings which were named after confederate legacy is directly equivalent to isis destroying cultural sites in the middle east. that s no better than what isis is doing, destroying museums and monuments, he said. i feel very strongly about this. i think it has gone far enough. there is some idea out there that certain parts of history out there don t matter anymore and that s a bunch of bunk. no. nobody in the south is ripping up roads or smashing buildings after executing the local population in order to cleanse confederate history. we are simply asking that it not continue to be glorified as some kind of noble cause.our founding fathers would have hated the guts of republicans like this guy. the founders embraced things like science. being smart, to them, was an advantage not a liability. the kkk was also not ever in its history a justice movement meant to keep the peace. its purpose through history was to restore white supremacy and terrorize former slaves, immigrants, catholics, jews, and anybody promoting the civil rights of the groups that the klan hated.remember republicans keep saying that their party is the party of civil rights because abraham lincoln was one of them. i sure am glad they cleared that up. otherwise, people like tommy benton would make me think the republican party is full of racists.watch local news coverage of an interview featuring benton belowyoutube image via video screen capture", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "what", "this", "georgia",

{"sample_id": 80, "text": "exclusive eu dismisses smoke regulation, looks into tougher fire safety tests. brusselslondon reuters there is no need for europewide rules on toxic smoke from building materials, according to a report expected to be signed off by the eu executive over the coming weeks, disappointing campaigners who say regulation is urgently needed following london s deadly grenfell tower fire. the european commission is, however, considering euwide fire safety testing for building facades and will conclude a study early next year, according to eu sources, who asked not to be named. debate on fire safety has intensified since the grenfell tower apartment block fire that killed about 80 people in june. an investigation into the fire is underway and it remains unclear what role, if any, smoke played in the tragedy. more generally, firefighters say one of their biggest concerns is smoke because of research linking it to cancer. they also say synthetic materials produce more deadly smoke than natural products. the responses received do not agree that regulation of toxicity of smoke from construction products is required, extracts from the final report seen by reuters showed. it found there was not sufficient evidence that member states want euwide smoke regulation and cited concerns it could add to building costs. there is general agreement that regulation of toxicity of smoke of construction products could increase product costs and potentially remove some products from the market, is another conclusion. it does not name them. two sources, who asked not to be named, said the commission expected to review, finalize and publish the report after the end of this month, but a publication date had yet to be confirmed. the commission had asked for the report to help resolve an argument between fire safety campaigners and the plastics industry. trade body plastics europe, which represents companies such as exxonmobil, total and basf, says there is no evidence that rules on smoke would save lives and there are multiple factors to consider when assessing a building s safety. toxicity criterion for construction products will not per se guarantee more safety in the eventuality of a fire, plastics europe said in a position paper. the european commission declined to comment. firefighters and other safety campaigners say labeling products according to their toxicity when burned would address a lack of clear fire safety regulations for builders. had the construction products regulation incorporated fire toxicity into the product labeling, it would have been very clear to the architects and designers that they were putting the occupants of grenfell in danger, said richard hull, a professor of fire science at the university of central lancashire in england. for now, the eu only sets standards to ensure construction materials can be shipped across borders within the bloc, although eu sources said the commission decided long before the grenfell fire to draw up the planned rules to harmonise firesafety tests for building facades. in addition, the grenfell tower fire led the commission to set up a fire information exchange platform to share safety information among member states. it met in brussels for the first time on oct. 16. sian hughes, chair of fire safe europe, said harmonized testing for facades would be a step forward but for highrise buildings it was impossible for any test to accurately predict a reallife fire. we must design the risk out of these buildings and that means only permitting noncombustible materials in these buildings from the start, she said. fire safe europe brings together fire fighters, representatives of the concrete and cable industries, and equipment and insulation companies including danishlisted rockwool and germany s knauf insulation. it says around 40 percent of deaths in fires are caused directly by smoke, while a further 20 percent are caused by a combination of severe burns and smoke.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "exclusive", "eu", "dismiss", "##es", "smoke", "regulation", ",", "looks", "into", "tough", "##er", "fire", "safety", "tests", ".", "brussels", "##lon",

{"sample_id": 81, "text": "democrat gun control sitin sparks social media sensation. reuters a blackout of television cameras in the u.s. house representatives during the democrats gun control sitin may have spurred public interest in the protest as it forced the demonstrators to use social media to broadcast their message. democrats leapt on facebook live and twitters periscope after the cameras, controlled by the house, went dark wednesday when presiding house officer and republican representative ted poe declared the chamber not in order during the protest. as democrats took to alternative forms of video broadcasting, their message gained tremendous momentum from social media. on twitter, the hashtags nobillnobreak and holdthefloor have been tweeted at least 1.4 million times. of the roughly 20 members of congress who remained at the sitin overnight, 19 of them used facebook live for a total combined viewership of 3 million. it really connected with people out there, congressman scott peters told reuters. this whole phenomenon with live video struck a nerve. peters used the application periscope, which is connected to the social media platform twitter, to send out video. without that, think about it, it would have been a caucus meeting where we talk to ourselves, he added. in remarks wednesday outside the capitol, house democratic leader nancy pelosi praised how her party harnessed social media. without you and without the technology of periscope the sitin would just be a debate in the halls of congress unrecorded because they turned off the microphones, pelosi said. but we raised our voices. they turned off the cameras and we went to periscope. congressman mark takano, who began posting live videos from the chamber to his facebook page wednesday afternoon and continued to throughout the night, said the social media video helped him connect with constituents. once i got started with the live streaming i didnt feel like i could let down the people who were following me, said takano. it was a way to push out a message. even cspan, which typically broadcasts footage recorded by the house cameras, picked up live video from four different members of congress roughly two hours after the house cameras shut down, according to communications director howard mortman. it marked the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the house floor. something interesting is happening with facebook live thats bringing more openness to the political process, said mark zuckerberg, ceo of facebook, in a post to his social media profile thursday. its a way to share anything you want with the world using just your phone.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "democrat", "gun", "control", "sit", "##in", "sparks", "social", "media",

useless organization that s reaching for conflict in areas that are inherently more incestuous than anything. what a joke!major hollywood film and tv studios have long been criticized for failing to create a level playing field for women. while insiders and studies have highlighted the entertainment industry s onesided hiring practices in recent months and years, now the complainants have found an ally.the american civil liberties union of southern california and the national aclu women s rights project said tuesday they will ask federal and california civil rights agencies to investigate a systemic failure to hire female directors in film and television.the new york times reports those accused of gender discrimination include hollywood s major studios, networks and talent agencies, and all could potentially face litigagation, for what the aclu described as widespread and intentional discrimination.melissa goodman, director of the l.g.b.t., gender and reproductive justice project at the aclu of southern california, said women directors aren t working on an even playing field and aren t getting a fair opportunity to succeed gender discrimination is illegal. and really hollywood

{"sample_id": 83, "text": "factbox who will trump pick to lead the federal reserve?. reuters u.s. president donald trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of chair of the federal reserve. a nomination could come within weeks as the term of current chair janet yellen ends in february 2018. yellen will meet with trump about the job on thursday. for a graphic on the next chair of the federal reserve, click tmsnrt.rs2yqjh2i he faces a choice between two continuity candidates, yellen and governor jerome powell, and a clutch of outsiders, including gary cohn, currently his top economic advisor, former fed governor kevin warsh, and stanford university economics professor john taylor. here are short profiles of the candidates gary cohn, 57, director of the national economic council experience longtime goldman sachs employee and president and chief operating officer of the wall street bank from 2006 to 2017. education bachelors degree in business, american university policy positions cohns current job as director of the nec has given him little reason to comment on monetary policy, but he has worried in the past that the fed has been constrained by the actions of other central banks trying to keep their currencies weak. in his own words if we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by 3 percent, the world would be a much better place. pros to candidacy a practitioners understanding of financial markets at a time the fed is attempting to unwind its bond portfolio bought after the 2008 financial crisis the trust of the white house and many congressional republicans given cohns highprofile role in the trump administration cons to candidacy no formal economics background at a time when the fed leans ever more on econometric models to decipher mixed signals in inflation and employment data a decadeslong career at goldman sachs and a personal fortune worth at least 260 million, which could raise eyebrows when it comes to confirmation by the senate, where members on both sides see the investment bank as a symbol of financial industry excess criticism of trump in the wake of charlottesville, virginia, protests jerome powell, 64, federal reserve governor experience lawyer and investment banker partner in private equity firm carlyle group from 19972005 senior treasury official under george h.w. bush fed governor since 2012 appointed by president obama education bachelors degree in politics, princeton university law degree from georgetown university policy positions powell has never dissented while at the fed, and in line with yellen supports slowly raising interest rates as long as the economy continues growing and inflation is expected to rise. he advocates easing some aspects of the doddfrank regulations and has discussed ways to revise the volcker rule. in his own words the committee has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends ... i would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates. pros to candidacy an uncontroversial pick for the position, could be the compromise who both replaces yellen and provides continuity only republican currently on the board of governors, has already helped guide the economy in its recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in congress familiarity with markets and financial regulation may be considered a plus cons to candidacy as a current fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the republican party, may not provide enough of a change if trump decides to replace yellen expertise is less in formal economics and more in markets and financial regulation, which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision, randal quarles john taylor, 70, senior fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution experience undersecretary of treasury for international affairs in the george w. bush administration from 2001 to 2005 member of council of economic advisers under presidents jimmy carter and george h. w. bush education phd in economics, stanford university policy positions developer of the eponymous taylor rule for setting interest rates, taylor feels the fed should transition to a rulesbased policy in order to make its decisionmaking predictabletransparentaccountable. in his own words it is very important to have a basic understanding of the monetary policy strategy. the fomc should be required to adopt and explain its monetary strategy, and then compare that strategy with monetary policy rules that are out there in a transparent way. pros to candidacy a trained economist whose elegantly simple research in the 1990s transformed the debate over how central banks set rates support among key capitol hill republicans who feel the fed has too much discretion well known in central banking circles, even if his ideas are not universally supported cons to candidacy a longterm member of the central banking and academic cliques trump may want to disrupt advocacy of rulebased policy may land with a thud in an institution that thrives on consensus and judgment break with yellen and current policy framework could disrupt markets if taylor insists on broad reform kevin warsh, 47, visiting fellow at stanford universitys hoover institution experience fed governor from 2006 to 2011 economic adviser to president george w. bush from 2002 to 2006 ma lawyer at morgan stanley for seven years education bachelors degree in public policy, stanford university law degree from harvard university policy positions warsh feels the fed should not try to finetune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion. he feels the fed should aim for inflation between 1 and 2 percent, effectively lowering its inflation target. in his own words we should not accept the feds newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real shortterm interest rate r is a fixed feature of future monetary policy ... the central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the feds strategy, tools, governance, and communications. pros to candidacy former banker and for several years former fed chair ben bernankes righthand man on financial markets, has a familiarity with wall street wife jane lauder warsh is a daughter of cosmetics magnate ron lauder, a longtime friend of trump served on the presidents economic advisory council before it disbanded cons to candidacy may be seen as too hawkish by a president who calls himself a low interest rate person not an academic economist like yellen or bernanke but has still maintained u.s. monetary policy needs a full makeover worried about inflation even as the 2008 financial crisis hit, and quit the fed over its second round of bondbuying, a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the quantitative easing program even while quitting over fed bond buying, never dissented on fomc decisions janet yellen, 71, federal reserve chair experience also served as a fed governor, president of the san francisco fed, and the feds vice chair from 2010 to 2014 education phd in economics, yale university policy positions yellen steered the fed towards gradual rate increases and a slow reduction of its balance sheet, dependent on evidence of a continued economic recovery. she argues that postcrisis financial regulation has made the economy more stable without sacrificing growth. in her own words my colleagues and i may have misjudged the strength of the labor market ... or even the fundamental forces driving inflation ... how should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? in my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments. pros to candidacy after a career in the fed system and four years as its head, has earned the trust of markets and shown she can shift policy without major disruption a growing economy, low unemployment, and strong stock markets make the case for continuity, while trump has said publicly he feels she is doing a good job cons to candidacy could be seen as a democratic holdover by a president who may want to put his own stamp on the fed feels the core regulations approved after the financial crisis should remain intact, a possible friction with the administrations deregulatory bent some republican leaders

{"sample_id": 84, "text": "close trump ally just admitted he communicates with wikileaks. trump s supporters, and some in the press, believe that if it wasn t for trump being a disgusting sexual predator, hillary clinton would have been done when wikileaks released a bunch of emails from her campaign. however, an aide to hillary, john podesta, has made an interesting connection, too. one of trump s close allies, roger stone, communicates with wikileaks.and stone has just admitted to it. i do have a backchannel communication with assange, because we have a good mutual friend, stone told cbs4 news miami wednesday evening. that friend travels back and forth from the united states to london and we talk. i had dinner with him last monday. he claims he doesn t have direct communication with assange, though, and he insists he has nothing to do with their email dump. democrats and u.s. officials believe that wikileaks might be working with russia on this, which wouldn t be surprising since they hacked the dnc over the summer and are showing interest in trying to rig our election.podesta has also accused stone of having advance knowledge of what was going to be in wikileaks email dump an accusation that stone flatly denies i have a backchannel communications with wikileaks, stone told nbc news. but they certainly don t clear or tell me in advance what they re going to do. what s the point of the communication, then? given what wikileaks is busy doing trying to expose hillary as corrupt, which could tilt the election in trump s favor it s not really all that difficult to imagine that this backchannel communication is actually collusion directly between stone and assange.in fact, back in august, stone said he was in direct communication with assange and that they were actively working to bring down hillary s campaign. speaking to the southwest broward republican organization, stone referred directly to the socalled october surprise, saying, according to mediaite well, it could be any number of things. i actually have communicated with assange. i believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the clinton foundation but there s no telling what the october surprise may be. lately, it seems that everything anyone involved with trump tries to do to bring hillary and the democrats down backfires. if stone communicates with wikileaks, that implicates the trump campaign. he s admitted to backchannel communication. he has said he s spoken to assange, although he denies it now. this won t look good for trump s already faltering campaign.featured image

{"sample_id": 85, "text": "office of government ethics orders white house to punish kellyanne conway for breaking law. unwilling to do the right thing himself, the united states office of government ethics just sent trump a letter asking him to punish kellyanne conway for her clear violation of the law in promoting ivanka s clothing line.conway told a giddy fox news morning crew that she loves ivanka s clothing and urged viewers to rush out to buy more of the merchandise all while standing in the white house briefing room.the oge, like many independent lawyers, pointed out that this was a blatant violation of conflict of interest laws. even more infuriating, the white house appears to have made no effort to discipline conway for a violation that many assumed would end in her termination.although press secretary sean spicer stated during a press conference on february 9, 2017, that, kellyanne has been counseled, and that s all we re going to go with, oge has not yet received notification of any disciplinary or other corrective ation against ms. conway. when ofge has reason to believe that an employee may have violated the standards of ethical conduct for employees of the executive branch, oge is authorized to recommend that the employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action against the employee.the oge again reiterated that, given conway s shameless plug on national television, the evidence is plain to see and that disciplinary action is warranted. meanwhile, trump is busy throwing his national security advisor under the bus after the washington post proved that michael flynn did, in fact, illegally discuss russian sanctions with russia s ambassador to the u.s. before trump was inaugurated. conway would represent the second highprofile advisor that trump would have to jettison for separate ethics violations in a single week surely some kind of record.so far, trump has refused to do anything to punish conway. in fact, he, too, used his station as president to promote his daughter s clothing line, tweeting a hit job on the nordstrom retail chain for dropping her brand from its stores.featured image

{"sample_id": 86, "text": "this state is honoring obama and sending a middle finger to trump at the same time you can bet hell be fuming. president obama s home state of illinois has passed a bill honoring him by designating his birthday august 4 as a state holiday. so now, every year on august 4, illinois has a state holiday known as barack obama day. while illinois has a democratic supermajority in its general assembly, bills must still be signed into law by the governor, and illinois governor is a republican.once known as senate bill 55, it reads barack obama day observed throughout the state as a day set apart to honor the 44th president of the united states of america who began his career serving the people of illinois in both the illinois state senate and the united states senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of americans and building bridges across communities. they re also renaming a large chunk of i55, running from just southwest of the city of chicago to near bloomingtonnormal, in the center of the state. that will become the barack obama presidential expressway. that may well rankle donald trump and his supporters, who insist that obama was the worst thing ever to happen to this country. trump spent a lot of time on obama s case for his vacations, which is one of the most hypocritical things he does. he also falsely accused obama of tapping his phones in trump tower, and trump has been steadily working to dismantle everything obama ever did.trump has claimed he s the most presidential president this country has ever had with the possible exception of abraham lincoln, and he says he s already gotten more done than fdr. except, you know, he s gotten zilch done and he s a manbaby on twitter. he politicized his speech to the boy scouts, where he again bragged about himself and actually got the audience to boo obama.would new york give trump a holiday? probably not, since he lost that state last year and they aren t exactly fond of him there. but who cares about illinois, right? that state only produced both abraham lincoln and ronald reagan two heroes of a republican party that s desperate for new heroes.featured image

{"sample_id": 87, "text": "china defends its right to ready slingshot in south china sea. beijing reuters china defended its right on thursday to put necessary military installations on artificial islands in the south china sea, after a u.s. thinktank said beijing appeared to have deployed weapons such as antiaircraft and antimissile systems. the asia maritime transparency initiative amti at the center for strategic and international studies said its findings, made available first to reuters on wednesday, were based on analysis of satellite images of islands in the strategic trade route, where territory is claimed by several countries. the united states has previously criticized what it called chinas militarization of its maritime outposts, and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered beijing. chinas defence ministry said in a statement on its website on thursday that the construction it had carried out on islands and reefs in the disputed spratlys chain was mainly for civilian use. as for necessary military installations, they are mainly for defence and selfprotection and are legitimate and lawful, it said. if someone makes a show of force at your front door, would you not ready your slingshot? the united states has conducted four freedom of navigation patrols, seen as a challenge to chinas extensive territorial claims in the south china sea, in the past year or so, most recently in october. amti said satellite images of islands china has built in the spratlys showed what appeared to be antiaircraft guns and what were likely to be closein weapons systems ciws to protect against cruise missile strikes. other images showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said. beijing regards the islands as its sovereign territory, and has often said it is entitled to limited and necessary defensive installations. amti director greg poling said the thinktank had spent months trying to figure out the purposes of the structures shown in the images. this is the first time that were confident in saying they are antiaircraft and ciws emplacements. we did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there, he told reuters. this is militarization. the chinese can argue that its only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant antiaircraft gun and ciws emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict. chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing in beijing that he did not understand the situation referred to in the amti report. the nansha islands are chinas inherent territory. chinas building of facilities and necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own territory is completely normal, he said, using chinas name for the spratlys. if chinas building of normal facilities and deploying necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own islands is considered militarization, then what is the sailing of fleets into the south china sea? the philippines, one of several countries with competing territorial claims in the south china sea, said it was still verifying the report. but if true it is a big concern for us and the international community who use the south china sea lanes for trade, said defence minister delfin lorenzana. it would mean that the chinese are militarising the area which is not good. lorenzanas comments were made during a visit to singapore with president rodrigo duterte, where he also said the united states had agreed to sell the philippine navy two advanced radar systems to boost its surveillance capability in the south china sea. australia too voiced concerns about chinas actions in the disputed waterway. the building of artificial islands and the possible militarization is creating an environment of tension and mistrust between claimants and other regional states, said foreign minister julie bishop in a statement. we urge claimants to refrain from coercive behavior and unilateral actions designed to change the status quo in disputed areas. u.s. presidentelect donald trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has criticized chinese behavior in the south china sea, while signaling he may adopt a tougher approach to chinas assertive behavior in the region than president barack obama. the state department said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but spokesman john kirby added we consistently call on china as well as other claimants to commit to peacefully managing and resolving disputes, to refrain from further land reclamation and construction of new facilities and the militarization of disputed features.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "china", "defend", "##s", "its", "right", "to", "ready", "sling",

agreement that sufficient progress had been made to begin talks about trade and a twoyear brexit transition period that will start when britain leaves the eu on march 29, 2019. negotiators in london, brussels and dublin worked through the night before breaking an impasse over the status of the irish border, the last major obstacle to the opening of trade talks which eu leaders are due to bless at a summit on dec. 15. but though the irish prime minister called a british pledge to avoid a destabilising hard border for northern ireland a bulletproof commitment, one senior eu official conceded that wording to appease may s belfast allies was a fudge which had simply put off until later the need to square the circle . while northern ireland would remain aligned with the rules of the eu s single market and customs union under which member state ireland operates, may s government is officially committed to leaving both the single market and customs union. actual negotiations on a trade pact that may take several years to agree may not start for some months. but eu officials said they should be ready to start rapid talks in january to give may the transition period she wants to reassure business that not much will change for a couple of years after brexit. speaking before sunrise at the eu executive s headquarters after a hurried flight on a royal air force plane, may said opening up trade talks would bring certainty for citizens and businesses about britain s future after quitting the eu. the most difficult challenge is still ahead, european council president donald tusk cautioned. we all know that breaking up is hard. but breaking up and building a new relationship is much harder. may, looking weary after just a couple of hours sleep, spoke after commission president jeanclaude juncker announced the breakthrough, first in english and then in german and french. the move to agree trade talks 18 months after the united kingdom s shock vote to exit the eu allayed some fears of a disorderly brexit that could disrupt trade between the world s biggest trading bloc and its sixthlargest national economy. sterling was dented when lastminute objections from belfast forced may to abort a deal on monday while already in brussels, but it climbed to a sixmonth high against the euro eurgbpd3 on friday. it later gave up earlier gains and turned lower on the day against the eu common currency as investors took profits after a sharp rally in recent days. facing 27 other members of the bloc, may largely conceded to the eu on the structure, timetable and substance of the negotiations. moving to talks about trade and a brexit transition was crucial for may s own future after her premiership was thrown into doubt when she lost the ruling conservative party its majority in an unwisely called snap election in june. i very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead, said may, a 61yearold anglican vicar s daughter who herself voted to stay in the eu in the june 2016 referendum but has repeatedly insisted britain will make a success of brexit. a senior british banker said the deal signalled may would stay in power for now and that britain was heading toward a much closer postbrexit relationship with the eu than many had feared. irish prime minister leo varadkar agreed. ...what phase one was always about was narrowing the parameters, and we are now funnelling and directing things into a situation where i believe the united kingdom including northern ireland will remain in alignment with the eu on lots of regulations, he told irish national broadcaster rte on friday evening. heralding pitfalls ahead, however, scotland s leader nicola sturgeon swiftly cited the promise of free trade on the irish border as removing an argument used to dissuade scots from breaking their union with england to rejoin the european union. draft guidelines showed the transition period, which would start on march 30, 2019, could last around two years, as may has requested. during that time, britain will remain part of the eu s customs union and single market but no longer take part in eu institutions or have a vote. it will also still be subject to eu law. probrexit conservative lawmakers rallied around her after the deal. this looked like a signal that the party, which has been split over eu membership for generations, was not preparing to ditch her immediately despite the election fiasco in june that left her government dependent on the support of northern ireland s democratic unionist party dup. british foreign secretary boris johnson, who spearheaded the 2016 brexit campaign, congratulated may, adding that britain would now take back control of its laws, money and borders. supporters of a radical brexit were tougher. brexit campaigner nigel farage struck a jarring note saying it was extraordinary a british premier had conceded so much in the middle of the night, agreeing to all the demands of juncker, tusk and eu negotiator michel barnier. the british prime minister has to fly through the middle of the night to go and meet three unelected people, who condescendingly say now, jolly well done may, you ve met every single one of our demands, thank you very much, we can now move on to the next stage . asked for an example of the eu conceding something to london, which says it will pay 4045 billion euros over many years to meet eu obligations, barnier said brussels dropped a demand that britain bear relocation costs for two eu agencies that are leaving london costs in the hundreds of millions. juncker once put the brexit bill at some 60 billion euros 52.7 billion but barnier said it was not possible to calculate a firm figure as much depended on future developments. jeremy corbyn, the socialist leader of britain s main opposition labour party, said on friday he wanted to see much more information about the divorce deal before he could judge whether it was a breakthrough. corbyn said labour had consistently called for maintaining the benefits of belonging to the eu s customs union and single market during a transitional period as britain leaves the bloc. the transitional period is unspecific and i think she needs to bring some clarity to that, he said on a visit to geneva. the eu had insisted it would only move on to trade talks if there was enough progress on three key issues the money britain must pay to the eu rights for eu citizens in britain and british citizens in the eu and how to avoid a hard border with ireland. i believe we have now made the breakthrough we needed, juncker said. on citizens rights, london and brussels agreed to offer equal treatment on social security, healthcare, employment and education and that britain will enable its judges to ask the european court of justice to weigh in when necessary for eight years after brexit, aiming to create a common body of law. but the crucial breakthrough was on the future of the 310mile 500km ukeu land border on the island of ireland. the northern irish dup had vetoed a draft deal on monday. may stayed up most of the night into friday, grabbing just a couple of hours sleep, as she worked the phones from downing street to secure agreement from dublin, brussels and the dup. they agreed to avoid a hard border which might upset the peace established after decades of protestantcatholic violence, but said the details would be agreed as part of talks about the future relationship, according to a 15page negotiators report. britain agreed that should london and brussels fail to agree a final brexit deal, the united kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union that help protect northsouth cooperation in ireland. in all circumstances, the united kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for northern ireland s businesses to the whole of the united kingdom internal market, it said. the dup gave only a conditional endorsement of the new terms we cautioned the prime minister about proceeding with this agreement in its present form given the issues which still need to be resolved, its leader arlene foster said. nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and how we vote on the final deal will depend on its contents. it remains unclear how britain can fully meet all three key pledges it has made on the border keeping northern irish rules in line with the eu, keeping northern ireland aligned with the uk mainland and allowing the uk to diverge from eu regulations. it s still a fudge, said one senior eu official. they put off squaring the circle till later. but how can they do it? for brussels and dublin, however, the key commitment was the first. the rest is theresa may s problem, the official said. 1 0.8510 euros",

{"sample_id": 89, "text": "u.s. attorney general says tech companies should help access encrypted evidence. reuters attorney general jeff sessions on thursday accused technology companies of failing to adequately help federal investigators access encrypted communications, saying over the past year that the fbi was blocked from accessing nearly 7,500 mobile devices. sessions criticized the technology sector in a speech in new york city, just two days after sayfullo saipov, an uzbek immigrant, allegedly drove a truck down a lower manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11. saipov said he was inspired by islamic state videos, according to investigators. sessions, speaking at the u.s. attorneys office not far from the site of the attack, addressed the tragedy by offering his condolences. he then laid out a threepoint plan to combat terrorism more generally, which he said should include new immigration restrictions, improved access to electronic communications and continued efforts to aggressively surveill noncitizen terrorists overseas. terrorists should know this administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal, sessions said, saying such tools will include using both federal courts and military proceedings at guantanamo bay prison in cuba to prosecute terrorism suspects. if anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the department of justice has convicted of terrorismrelated offenses since 911, he said, referring to the sept. 11, 2001, attacks on new york and washington. and they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in guantanamo bay. sessions did not say whether he thought that saipov should be sent to guantanamo, though he did voice support for a proposal by president donald trump to scrap a diversity visa program and replace it with a meritbased system. on wednesday, trump said he would consider sending saipov to a military prison at guantanamo. no detainee has been sent to there since 2008. sessions on thursday also harshly criticized silicon valley, saying technology companies too often refuse to cooperate with law enforcement or even to comply with court orders. as an example, he cited a 2015 terrorist incident in garland, texas, after two gunmen opened fired with assault rifles at an exhibit featuring caricatures of the prophet mohammed. sessions said one of the terrorists had sent more than 100 instant messages to another terrorist overseas. what we dont know, however, is what he said because those messages are encrypted, he said. the justice department in recent weeks has been signaling it plans to take a tougher stance with technology companies over accessing encrypted data. last month, deputy attorney general rod rosenstein also discussed the topic, and suggested attempts to negotiate with the tech sector were a waste of time because they valued profit over stopping crime.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "u", ".", "s", ".", "attorney", "general", "says", "tech",

{"sample_id": 91, "text": "breaking iran throws down ultimatum your move barry. the nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors. iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khameneiso many lies is it finally time for the us to act before it s too late?iran s president on thursday said tehran will not sign a final nuclear deal unless world powers lift economic sanctions imposed on the country immediately.the united states, united kingdom, france, russia, china and germany the socalled p5 1 group reached an understanding with iran last week on limits to its nuclear program in return for lifting crippling economic sanctions, after extended talks in lausanne, switzerland.the u.s. has previously said the sanctions would be lifted in phases, but the details have not yet been negotiated.however, in a televised speech on thursday, president hassan rouhani appeared to rule out a gradual removal of the successive round of sanctions that have hit hard its energy and financial sectors and crippled its economy. we will not sign any deal unless all sanctions are lifted on the same day, rouhani said, according to reuters. we want a winwin deal for all parties involved in the nuclear talks. rouhani was speaking at a ceremony to mark iran s nuclear technology day. the iranian nation has been and will be the victor in the negotiations, he said.the deal negotiated in switzerland says that sanctions will be suspended after international monitors verify that iran is abiding by the limitations set out, and that the sanctions will resume if iran fails to fulfill its obligations. it has never been our position that all of the sanctions against iran should be removed from day one, white house spokesman josh earnest said monday.iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on thursday said there is no guarantee a full agreement will be reached by the end of june, the afp news agency reported. what has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end, he said, according to the agency. everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side the six world powers, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details, he added. officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. i am neither for nor against. the nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors. negotiators have until june 30 to fill in the critical details to assure iran it will get relief from the sanctions as soon as possible, and guarantee the world powers that iran won t develop a nuclear weapon.rouhani on thursday also called for an end to airstrikes by a saudiled coalition in yemen, and said they were a mistake. not singling out any country in particular, he said, you learned that it was wrong. you will learn, not later but soon, that you are making mistake in yemen, too, the associated press reported.wouldn t that be considered a threat?rouhani also called for a ceasefire in yemen to enable talks to end the crisis, the ap said, adding to calls by the red cross and russia for a ceasefire to allow aid into the wartorn nation.on wednesday, the pentagon said the u.s. military has begun airrefueling operations for the coalition conducting the airstrikes, as shiite rebels known as houthis continued their advance on the southern port city of aden.the pentagon also said the united states would expedite delivery of ammunition including bombs and guidance systems to the saudis and other coalition members.via usa today", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "breaking", "iran", "throws", "down",

that didn t happen, she came up with another idea for 200 pounds of clinton confetti that went unused to encase it glass snow globes with a metal placard inside that reads and still i rise a reference to a maya angelou poem of the same name.bunny burson made 1,000 of the special snow globes, which she s selling at the grand opening of her and still i rise art exhibit at the anderson ranch arts center in snowmass village. planned parenthood gets the proceeds nothing says breaking the glass ceiling like giving money to a baby killing, body parts selling factory like planned parenthood.the globes sold locally will go to the arts center, while proceeds from sales elsewhere will go to planned parenthood, according to the news site. it was a natural progression when this happened, as sad as it was, to use the confetti to lift people up including myself, bunny burson said at the opening tuesday. it was cathartic for me to make the work, and i want young women and girls who see it to be able to do what they dream of doing and break the glass ceiling. while bunny wallows in the election loss, the vanity fair editors are begging hillary to find a hobby so she won t run againmaybe its

{"sample_id": 94, "text": "alabama attorney general named to jeff sessions senate seat. reuters alabamas state attorney general will fill the u.s. senate seat vacated by republican jeff sessions after his confirmation as attorney general of the united states, governor robert bentley said on thursday. luther strange, also a republican, will hold the senate seat until a special election in 2018, the governors office said in a statement. sessions, 70, served two decades as a senator for alabama before being confirmed on wednesday as president donald trumps attorney general. a senate divided by concerns over his record on civil rights voted 5247, largely along party lines. strange, a 63yearold former basketball player at tulane university nicknamed big luther for his size, had announced his plans to run for the seat after trump nominated sessions. i pledge to the people of alabama to continue the same level of leadership as jeff sessions in consistently fighting to protect and advance the conservative values we all care about, strange said in a statement following his appointment. alabama voters first elected strange as attorney general in 2010. bentley on thursday highlighted stranges role in negotiating the landmark settlement agreement with bp for the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico. according to local media, alabama lawmakers said strange asked them last year to suspend their impeachment investigation of bentley over allegations he had an affair with a former political adviser and used state resources to pursue it. the republican governor has denied the affair and any wrongdoing. lawmakers said strange was conducting a related probe, but the attorney generals office has not said whether it was investigating the governor, according to the montgomery advertiser newspaper. a spokeswoman for the attorney generals office did not have an immediate comment on the reports. the governors office said bentley conducted more than 20 hours of interviews with candidates before tapping strange for the senate seat. bentley said strange would be sworn in on thursday.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "alabama", "attorney", "general", "named", "to",

{"sample_id": 95, "text": "austria puts the squeeze on refugees with benefit cuts. vienna reuters ahmed ali, a 34yearold teacher, fled the war in syria two years ago and settled in a quiet austrian town on the hilly border with the czech republic. he was hoping to raise a family there. but voter attitudes towards immigrants have hardened due to concerns about security and the economy after austria took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015. this fueled support for the farright party freedom party and its candidate came close to winning last year s presidential election. immigration is still the dominant political issue ahead of the oct. 15 parliamentary election. in january, lawmakers in lower austria, where ali lived, reduced benefits for new arrivals. they said the benefits system needed protecting from being overstretched by the influx of refugees. ali and his pregnant wife moved again to vienna in july, where their benefits would still be paid in full. most of us fled when the letter came telling us our social benefits would be cut. at first we didn t believe it but then we saw it on our bank balance, said ali, who says his german is not yet good enough to find work. three of austria s nine provinces lower austria, burgenland and upper austria have reduced benefits for new arrivals. foreign minister sebastian kurz, leader of the conservative people s party which is leading in the polls, wants to make similar cuts apply to the whole country. chancellor christian kern, whose social democratic party polls show competing with the freedom party for second place, has resisted the idea but said he could support them in cases where new arrivals turn down job offers. so far, the cuts have primarily impacted migrants like ali who sought asylum in austria when it opened its border in 2015 although some austrians returning home have also been caught. in burgenland the rules apply to all people seeking help who have spent fewer than five years of the six preceding their application for benefits in austria. a statement accompanying the upper austrian bill painted the cuts as a way to tackle the problem of welfare magnetism in the context of refugees. the lower austrian government declined to comment due to a legal challenge against the cuts. in a case brought by a charity, austria s constitutional court is expected to rule next year on whether the cuts by lower austria, decided in late 2016 and implemented since early 2017, are illegal. the 1951 united nations refugee convention says host countries must grant refugees the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as their own nationals. a 2011 eu directive sets a similar rule. the u.n. refugee agency unhcr, which has denounced xenophobic debates in austrian politics ahead of the election, has described the cuts as breaches of international and european law but no international cases have been started. a burgenland spokeswoman defended the benefits changes, saying they targeted austrian nationals as well. therefore there is no violation of ... the eu directive and the refugee convention, she said. a spokesman for kurz said legislation to expand the cuts would be passed and phrased in such a way that no doubt for the highest courts will emerge . the three provinces have cut benefits for new arrivals, even after obtaining asylum, to around 570 euros 669 a month, less than half the poverty threshold of 1,200 euros, compared with around 850 euros for an austrian who has never lived abroad. benefits for a household have been capped at 1,500 euros. rather than live off less than what is considered the bare minimum for most austrians, many of those affected have moved, particularly to the capital. ali moved to an apartment with his uncle and aunt in a dilapidated building on the outskirts of the city costing 1,100 euros a month. they don t care how many children you have. and maybe they ll cut again, ali said in his living room with two sofas, a television set and a picture of kurdish leader masoud barzani. he found more affordable apartments but the landlord did not want refugees as tenants. one landlady was concerned social benefits for refugees might be cut in vienna, too. instead of cutting the social safety net, integration and independence should be supported. we fear that language learning, training and the search for work will suffer if those affected don t know how to pay their rent anymore, said the chief the unhcr s austria office, christoph pinter. although the freedom party and kurz s conservatives have been the most vocal about cutting benefits for new arrivals, the three provinces that have put cuts in place are governed by various twoway combinations of all three main political parties. but most of those affected who spoke to reuters fear an election victory for kurz. if kurz wins, it will be a big problem, said 24yearold basel from deraa in syria. he moved from lower austria to vienna in july, leaving behind friends and a job as a hairdresser. he says the cuts paralyze people like him with fear. you stop thinking about the future. for a graphic

{"sample_id": 96, "text": "europe could be next mission for merkels mr fix it. berlin reuters peter altmaier once said he would never rise to the top tier of german politics because of his appearance he is a huge man who seems perpetually dishevelled, with shirt untucked and tie askew. but chancellor angela merkel s chief of staff and standin finance chief could become the most influential minister in her next coalition government, senior officials say. in recent years, merkel has often turned to altmaier, who is known as her allzweckwaffe all purpose weapon, to carry out the most sensitive and complex tasks, from securing majorities for unpopular greek bailouts to coordinating the government s response to the 2015 refugee crisis. since a sept. 24 election, he has also emerged as a bridge builder between the disparate parties in coalition talks. if the talks succeed, some officials believe merkel will try to keep him at the finance ministry so he can tackle what may be the biggest challenge of her fourth term brokering a deal with french president emmanuel macron on a reform of the european union. if merkel made him finance minister for this transition period, then it is a sign that she trusts him to do this job in the future, a senior aide to the chancellor told reuters. henrik enderlein, head of the delors institut in berlin, a think tank, said it would send a very strong signal to france if altmaier continued in the finance ministry post. the liberal free democrats fdp are expected to have first choice of ministry in the new government. but if their leader christian lindner does not claim the finance ministry for himself, altmaier could be in pole position. although the fdp and members of merkel s christian democrats cdu are skeptical about some of macron s proposals notably his idea to create a budget and finance minister for the euro zone some believe altmaier s tone alone would inject new momentum into the relationship between berlin and paris. altmaier, who declined to speak to reuters for this story, has not said publicly whether he is interested in becoming finance minister permanently after meeting french finance minister bruno le maire last week, he said not all proposals from paris would be greeted with unlimited enthusiasm . but he added i never made it a secret that i m an advocate of francogerman cooperation. a jovial 59yearold from the state of saarland on the french border, altmaier stands out among politicians and the officials in merkel s close entourage, dominated by technocrats. the son of a coal miner and a nurse, altmaier was the first prominent german politician to actively embrace twitter. he hosts extravagant dinners at his vast apartment in west berlin, cooking gefilde a saarland specialty of potato dumplings filled with liverwurst and soaked in a baconcream sauce for guests of all political stripes. altmaier speaks fluent english, french and dutch and, unlike his boss, is a master communicator. he also likes to make fun of himself, particularly his weight, which he estimated several years ago at 140 kilos 309 pounds but now describes as a state secret . i may not be the wichtigste most important minister but i am the gewichtigste heaviest, he has joked. after years as merkel s mr fix it , some cdu officials see him as a dark horse candidate to succeed the chancellor one day. as parliamentary whip for the cdu, he won over skeptics about the greek bailouts with homecooked meals and red wine. the thinner the majority, the fatter altmaier gets, bundestag members used to quip. later, as merkel s environment minister, he brought order to her nuclear power phaseout and was appointed her chief of staff in 2013. two years later, she turned to altmaier for help over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees and again this year to write the cdu s election program. in coalition talks between merkel s conservatives, the fdp and greens, altmaier has been a mediator, gently nudging the parties closer together, participants say. like merkel, he is a cdu moderate. after joining the bundestag in 1994, he incurred the wrath of traditionalists by pushing for a reform of strict german citizenship laws and the rehabilitation of world war two deserters. he was part of the pizza connection , a group of young lawmakers from the cdu and greens who met regularly at an italian restaurant in bonn, when the environmentalist party was viewed as a radical, fringe group by many conservatives. before entering german politics, altmaier studied european law and worked at the european commission, later participating in the european convention that led to the eu s lisbon treaty. altmaier is one of a small number of toptier german politicians who has real experience in brussels, said martin selmayr, chief of staff to european commission president jeanclaude juncker, who worked with altmaier in the convention in 2002. he is a committed european and would be a powerful proeuropean voice in any german government.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "europe", "could", "be", "next", "mission", "for", "mer", "##kel", "##s", "mr", "fix", "it", ".", "berlin", "reuters",

{"sample_id": 97, "text": "if trump had known about this nixon era law, he wouldnt have run for president. throughout the election, donald trump s tax returns have remained a mystery. he said he d release them if he won, but so far, crickets. it s not a giant leap to imagine that trump has something either incriminating or simply something bad in his taxes. would trump have run for president if he knew a little known law that makes every single presidential tax return go through an automatic audit?the last time we had a known tax evader in office was during the richard nixon administration. his vice president, spiro agnew, was forced to resign in 1973 after pleading guilty to tax evasion. nixon himself was twice audited by the irs. in 1974, he had to pay 465,000 worth of back taxes for a three year period.after that, nixon made all his tax returns public. since then, all but gerald ford, and now trump, have. the irs even passed a law requiring that all sitting presidents and vice presidents are audited every year. the requirement for mandatory audits of the tax returns of the president and vice president dates back to the watergate era in the 1970s, the irs said in a statement to mcclatchy, noting that nonpartisan career employees adopted the requirement. since then, this provision has remained in place during both republican and democratic administrations as well as under irs commissioners appointed by both parties. source mcclatchybefore you get too excited, the law also specifically outlines how the president s and vice president s taxes are handled in special orange folders, in a secure area and with confidentiality. in other words, if trump isn t breaking laws, we still won t be able to see his tax returns.there is a chance that trump could get the law overturned i don t believe there is anything that would prevent the president from instructing that this precautionary measure of the irs audits be rescinded, said norman eisen, who as special counsel to the obama white house during the first term put in place new ethics guidelines. he could theoretically do it. trump could even go beyond having that law overturned. many republicans want to abolish the irs altogether, which is a stupid idea, one which would surely bankrupt the country, but donald trump has shown himself to be thinskinned and completely selfinterested. if he has a beef with the irs, the republican congress could be sympathetic.featured image via drew angerergetty images", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "if", "trump", "had", "known", "about", "this", "nixon", "era", "law", ",", "he",

{"sample_id": 98, "text": "racist florida woman tells black people you should have stayed in africa in insane rant video. a racist white woman in florida is surely furious after her africanamerican neighbors posted a video of her dissolving into a hatefilled mess outside her home on a residential street in tallahassee, florida. the video was apparently recorded in march, but the teens who captured the magical moment in which this classy, white, pink bikiniclad lady unleashed a stream of verbal diarrhea all over the sidewalk, posted the footage online recently.the woman, who is apparently drunk, begins by making fun of the africanamerican females bodies. when a male in the back says black don t crack, baby, things went from zero to racist instantly. black don t crack? the likely trump voter responds. black is crack. crack is black! but she wasn t done there. the unidentified crackeramerican told the black btches her cute nickname for them you all should have stayed in africa. and you can go back there, it s free. you know you can go back to africa, if you want to. and you can take your washington and jefferson last names. one of the teens decided to remind her she is being recorded don t say nothing else but our intoxicated white friend was in fulltrump mode. we re gonna take over these neighborhoods, she says, continuing her slackjawed diatribe. martin luther king was a slt! he was a slt who was fcking white people. martin luther was fcking white people the day he died. ultimately, the lady s hatefilled frenzy became so irritating for her daughter, who was forced to stand in the background and attempt to ignore her mother s idiocy, had to step in. the daughter screamed mom, will you stop as she grabbed her hand and tried to pull her back. it s ridiculous that your own child has to tell you to stop, one of the teens said, and it truly is.featured image via screen capture", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "racist", "florida", "woman", "tells", "black",

{"sample_id": 99, "text": "iran says defense capabilities not negotiable amid u.s. pressure. beirut reuters iran s defense capabilities are not negotiable, supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said wednesday in remarks made previously but which now come amid increased pressure from the u.s. government over tehran s ballistic missile program. ties between iran and the united states have deteriorated under u.s. president donald trump and suffered another deep blow two weeks ago when he decided not to certify that tehran is complying with a 2015 nuclear pact and warning he might ultimately terminate it. iran has reacted defiantly, dismissing trump s demands for the pact to be toughened up. last week, iran s elite revolutionary guards, the most powerful military force in the country, said its ballistic missile program would accelerate despite u.s. and european union pressure to suspend it. the defense capabilities and strength of the country are not negotiable or up for haggling, khamenei was cited as saying at a ceremony at the imam ali army officer s academy in tehran, according to state media. the ramping up of rhetoric on both sides has raised the specter of a possible military confrontation between the two countries. in recent months, small boats from the revolutionary guards navy have swarmed close to american warships in the gulf, prompting the u.s. navy to fire flares and warning shots. under the landmark 2015 deal between iran and world powers, the islamic republic agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions. the u.s. senate is considering new legislation which could lead to washington restoring sanctions on iran should it test a ballistic missile able to carry a warhead or bar nuclear inspectors from any sites. in response, khamenei said last week that tehran would stick to the nuclear accord with world powers as long as the other signatories respected it, but would shred the deal if washington pulled out.", "tokens": ["[CLS]", "iran", "says", "defense", "capabilities", "not", "ne", "##go", "##tia", "##ble", "amid", "u", ".", "s", ".", "pressure", ".", "beirut", "reuters",
