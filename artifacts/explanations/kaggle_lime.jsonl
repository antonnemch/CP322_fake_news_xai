is from mississippi not missouri by laila kearney reuters many of president donald trumps core political supporters had a simple message on sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban calm down. the relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove trumps historic upset victory working and middleclass residents of midwest and the south provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. in the st. louis suburb of manchester, missouri, 72yearold jo ann tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate. somebody has to stand up, be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in, she said. im all for everybody to stop and take a breath just give it a chance. by executive order on friday, trump banned immigration from seven muslimmajority countries iran, iraq, syria, libya, somalia, sudan and yemen and temporarily halted the entry of refugees. in the electoral strongholds for trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. they shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country. in new york, los angeles, san francisco and other cities, trumps action set off an outpouring of anger. house minority leader nancy pelosi, a democrat from california, evoked an image of the statue of liberty weeping. senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the meanspirited and unamerican immigration ban. veterans in government agencies, including the homeland security and state departments, blasted trumps team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the white house rejected. at airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules. but allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said. louise ingram, a 69yearold retiree from troy, alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few glitches, such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect u.s. citizens from attacks. im not opposed to immigrants, she said. i just want to make sure they are safe to come in. a senior trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. they rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in san bernardino, california the boston marathon bombing and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in europe. the reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of france, germany and parts of belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the united states, one official told reuters. candace wheater, a 60yearold retired school cafeteria worker from spring lake, michigan, also referenced the attacks in brussels and paris. look at whats happening in europe, she said. i dont dare travel there, out of fear. steve hirsch, 63, from manassas, virginia, drove to washingtons dulles airport on sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did. he said he supported trumps order. a country is not a country if it doesnt have borders, he added. he lauded trumps actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security. he probably went as far as he thought he could, hirsch said. you cant ban everybody in the world, but i think its prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world. trent lott, a former senate republican leader from mississippi who is now a lawyer in washington, d.c., said the orders made sense to workingclass americans in the real world. out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border, he said. university of virginia political science professor larry sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt trump politically. his base is as firm as ever, he said. what hes lost in the very early polls is the republicans who were never trumpers and ended up voting for trump. trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites. trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the socalled rust belt, the midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns. whatever trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country. i just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about donald trump, sabato said. in baton rouge, louisiana, 40yearold teacher trista carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about trump out of the classroom. we were told to be switzerland, she said. were not allowed to take any sides or views. she has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them with no sugarcoating. i think its just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally, she said. i feel like he is going to to the best of his abilities make a lot of things he said happen.", "tokens":

{"sample_id": 8, "text": "pentagon seeks 583 billion budget for 2017 republicans say not enough. washington reuters the pentagon on tuesday proposed a 582.7 billion defense budget that emphasizes emerging threats from russia, china and islamic state rebels, but the plan is already under fire from republican lawmakers who charge it shortchanges the u.s. military. president barack obamas last budget would boost spending on the war against islamic state militants to 7.5 billion during the 2017 fiscal year, a 50 percent jump over the 5 billion approved this year. some 200 million of that would go to fight militants in north and west africa. the proposal also would quadruple funds to counter russian pressure in europe, including its seizure of ukraines crimean peninsula and repeated strategic bomber flights near nato air space. spending to boost u.s. military presence and training in europe would rise to 3.4 billion from 800 million this year. the budget heralds a strategic shift as washington looks beyond the wars in iraq and afghanistan and enters a new period of great power competition from russia and china as well as threats from smaller rivals like iran and north korea, officials said. this budget marks a major inflection point for the department of defense, defense secretary ash carter said in a statement. even as we fight todays fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come in 10, 20 or 30 years. overall, the administration is seeking a pentagon base budget of 523.9 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct. 1, plus 58.8 billion for war funding and overseas operations. the base budget is about 2.5 billion more than this years while war spending remains relatively flat, officials said. the spending proposal is in line with a congressional budget deal last year that set pentagon funding guidelines for 2016 and 2017. but republican lawmakers have criticized the war funding plan, saying the 59 billion figure in the budget deal was a floor, not a ceiling, and the president should have sought more. this request is inadequate to address the national security threats we face, senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a statement. congressman mac thornberry, chairman of the house armed services committee, accused the administration of playing budgetary games. mccain said by seeking the minimum level of war funding in the budget deal, the president had left the pentagon with 17 billion less than it estimated it would need for 2017 in last years budget. to make up the shortfall in planned spending, the pentagon cut more than 5 billion by adjusting its assumptions about expected fuel costs and inflation levels, pentagon comptroller mike mccord said. it also cut procurement to 112.1 billion, down 6 percent, from this year. the reductions would come mainly from planned aircraft purchases, including five fewer f35 joint strike fighters lmt.n and a reduction in several types of army helicoptersba.n, budget documents show. while cutting procurement, the pentagon proposed increasing spending on research and development by 4 percent, to 71.8 billion, as it looks to develop new technologies to give it a military edge. the department said it would spend 16.8 billion in its classified military intelligence accounts. it also agreed to delay until 2022 its controversial plan to retire the a10 close air support aircraft, which is being used in the fight against islamic state. retaining the aircraft will cost 3.4 billion over the fiveyear period. the budget would continue to shrink the size of the u.s. army, which will drop to 460,000 soldiers in 2017 from the current 475,000. separately, the presidents budget would fund a new 150 million polar icebreaker vessel to ensure yearround accessibility to the arctic for coast guard missions.", "tokens": ["reuters", "u", "s", "budget", "said", "russia", "major", "fiscal", "last", "8", "power", "costs", "mainly", "comptroller", "who"], "importances": [0.10937293278268986, 0.07108636537393435, 0.0664694651672027, 0.0577409226302604, 0.04901452349526819, 0.04460041811461929, 0.035530842796880915, -0.028770377750958906, -0.02613986191634094, 0.021668931647261327, -0.013828448529984872, -0.010548177530271359, -0.010003931303265517, 0.009684844393835264, -0.0091456146506211], "pred_label": 1, "true_label": 1, "dataset": "kaggle", "method": "lime"}

{"sample_id": 11, "text": "behind the scenes, ryan touts his agenda in cleveland, not trumps. cleveland reuters u.s. house speaker paul ryan offered his strongest support yet for donald trumps white house bid on tuesday at the republican national convention, saying the new york businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides america a chance at a better way. behind the scenes in cleveland, the highestranking elected republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party, backed by some wealthy donors and republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by trumps candidacy. the support reflects deep divisions within the party over trumps harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt american workers but establishment republicans view as central to their free trade policies. the split has created an identity crisis for the party, embodied in the figures of trump and ryan. everybody knows the tough spot paul ryan is in, said annie dickerson, a new york delegate to the convention and close adviser to republican financier paul singer, referring to ryans dilemma in backing a candidate as the partys standard bearer in the nov. 8 presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values. hes the antidote to all the frustration thats in cleveland this week, she said, noting that despite a public push for unity, there are those still unhappy with trumps nomination. ryan, 46, is chairman of the convention at which trump was officially nominated on tuesday. but he has kept a low profile, avoiding the conventions opening day on monday, and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of republican supporters, according to aides and attendees. at the meetings, according to attendees, ryan has been pushing his better gop platform, a sixpart agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism president george w. bush advocated reduced regulation, lower taxes, and welfare reform. it contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by trump, who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions. doug heye, a former house republican leadership aide close to ryan, said ryans platform gives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isnt divisive, that isnt name calling. heye said the approach could help ryan position himself as the face of the party if trump loses the election. ryan has publicly clashed with trump over the latters promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals. he criticized trumps call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a mexicanamerican judge racist. ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform, and as chairman of the house of representatives budget committee, he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government. the risk for ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional republican orthodoxy, and by not embracing trump he could find himself isolated. some of trumps supporters see him as emblematic of the washington dysfunction that has angered many republicans. mark bolin, a canton, ohio, business owner who supports trump, called ryans tepid endorsement of trump political suicide. he said ryan and other republicans leaders cant admit their own failures. instead of them thinking theres something wrong with their party, they think it must be us, the american people arent smart enough, bolin said. ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed ryan, who was the vice presidential nominee in 2012, to run for president this year. he declined but hasnt ruled out running in the future. advisers to singer and the billionaire industrialist koch brothers say the donors are banking on ryan to carry the flag for traditional republican values. i like ryan and his day to lead the party will come very soon, if trump loses, said energy magnate dan eberhart, another major donor. linda devore, 66, a retired attorney from fayetteville, north carolina, who met ryan for the first time in 2012, rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the cleveland. hes just one of the smartest republicans. thats what i told him, devore said. hes a quick wit. he said, pretty low bar, huh?", "tokens": ["reuters", "cleveland", "u", "another", "time", "taxes", "donor",

{"sample_id": 12, "text": "british parliament respected institution or den of vice?. london reuters from william pitt to winston churchill, britain s finest prime ministers have risen to greatness in the palace of westminster, heightening its reputation as one of the world s most respected parliaments. but with nine centuries of history come traditions, and a culture that is now under fire for concentrating power in the hands of lawmakers who can make or break the careers of aides, interns and party activists. the resignation of britain s defense minister, who admitted repeatedly touching a radio presenter s knee in 2002, and a series of accusations against other members of parliament, from alleged extramarital affairs to sexual assaults, have prompted calls for change. parliament is an old and famous institution, said brendan chilton, a labour activist and general secretary of labour leave, a probrexit group. however it has in recent years become a den of vice. we should all seek to make parliament the envy of the world again. the ornate palace of westminster, beside the river thames in the heart of london, is home to both the upper and lower houses of parliament and is seen by some historians as one of the birthplaces of modern democracy. but allegations about british politicians, many of them unsubstantiated, have surfaced since sexual abuse claims against hollywood producer harvey weinstein prompted women and men in british politics to share stories about improper behavior. claims of sexual harassment have prompted some newspapers to refer to parliament as pestminster . michael fallon resigned as defense minister on wednesday over past behavior he said had fallen below the high standards we require of the armed forces . two more ministers are under investigation by the governing conservative party into allegations of inappropriate behavior and the opposition labour party and scottish national party are looking into similar reports about party members. aweinspiring the palace of westminster s debating chambers, its lavish tea rooms and its maze of corridors with portraits of longgone politicians and prime ministers can inspire and confuse in equal measure. like a selfcontained village, it has it own post office, hairdresser, gym, restaurants and bars. there is little reason to leave and for many workers, days are spent in its offices and evenings are spent in its bars. drinking culture is both fun and a bit depressing, one parliamentary researcher wrote on the glassdoor website where employees and former employees anonymously review companies and their management. you will miss out on networking if this is not something you want to do. it is a heady mix, and many relationships have grown in an environment where people work closely together, and often under pressure, for long hours. but the allegations that have surfaced in recent weeks also depict it as an environment where inappropriate behavior is widespread and a laddish culture, where what one person sees as a joke is offensive to another, prevails. the accusations describe parliament as a place where careers of researchers, interns and aides can be decided by the member of parliament or minister they work for and suggest some fear for their future if they refuse sexual advances. many female lawmakers have welcomed the opportunity to share their experiences, some of which they have kept silent about for years for fear of, if not reprisals, criticism from colleagues or officials for bringing parties into disrepute. there is obviously a problem, it s a good thing that it s been exposed, labour lawmaker harriet harman told parliament this week. no one should have to work in the toxic atmosphere of sleazy sexist or homophobic banter. scandals involving members of british politicians are not new. the profumo affair, involving sex, a soviet spy and the secretary of state for war, helped bring down the conservative government in 1963. twenty years later, conservative cecil parkinson resigned as trade and industry minister over an affair with his secretary, who became pregnant. but fallon told the bbc that what had been acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now . the government is introducing measures to tackle sexual harassment, including measures to enforce a code of conduct and to set up an independent grievance procedure. but critics say the power disparity between lawmaker and employee will remain.", "tokens": ["reuters", "s", "measure", "its", "officials", "grown", "culture",

{"sample_id": 13, "text": "were not catalonia italys separatists tread softly toward autonomy. milan, italy reuters as nervous investors retreat from catalonia, afraid the wealthy region may secede from spain, another european region whose politicians once campaigned for independence is looking to attract some of them by talking of autonomy, not secession. the italian region of lombardy, the country s industrial engine and home to its financial capital milan, is holding a referendum on sunday for more autonomy, an outcome its onceproudly secessionist leader hopes will lure more investment. that could come at the expense of catalonia, which is a rival to lombardy in the race to attract employers fleeing another painful european divorce, brexit. the two regions are competing to host europe s drugs regulator which must leave the uk and find a new home inside the european union. we are not catalonia, said lombardy president roberto maroni, overlooking milan from his glasswalled office on the 36th floor of the region s recently built headquarters. we remain inside the italian nation with more autonomy while catalonia wants to become the 29th state of the european union. we, no. not for now. he speaks of catalonia as a competitor in some respects but says he is not deliberately courting its firms. we are not cheering because firms are fleeing catalonia. we will see what happens but i haven t had any requests yet from catalan firms. maroni is a leading member of lega nord, which began in the 1990s to campaign for an independent state of padania, stretching across italy s north, roughly following the po river from around lombardy in the west to venice in the east. lega nord no longer actively campaigns for secession but as the ruling party in lombardy and in the veneto region around venice, it is holding referendums in both for greater autonomy, including a better financial deal from the central government. a yes vote would not be binding on rome, but maroni said it would give him a strong mandate to negotiate a better deal. it s obvious that the more negotiating power i have, the more money i can manage to bring home, he said. rome says the referendum is unnecessary, though permitted under italy s constitution, which allows regions to open talks for more autonomy. italy s ruling democratic party is also neutral on the issue, though at least one of the party s mayors in lombardy is calling for a yes vote. like catalonia, lombardy makes up a fifth of the national economy and complains that the center is draining its finances. but unlike catalonia, where hundreds of firms have shifted headquarters to other regions of spain since an oct. 1 independence referendum there, lombardy s boss is taking a softer line and using his autonomy push as an investment pitch. maroni says lombardy pays 54 billion euros 64 billion more in taxes to rome each year than it receives from the center. he wants to reduce that difference by half. maroni says he would spend some of that money on research and development, nurturing familyowned businesses and startups and tax holidays to attract big international firms. for example, he said, he could tell big multinationals looking to invest in europe you know that if you come to milan, for two or three years i won t make you pay taxes. rome, though, is in no position to allow its most economically powerful region such a windfall without risking economic collapse in the alreadypoor south, experts say. it s a zerosum game, said professor luca ricolfi, an expert on federalism at the university of turin. gian claudio bressa, junior minister for regional affairs in rome, said it was not a matter of just handing back money. regions must show they can take over public services from the national government and do a better job at providing them. only then are more funds allocated to a newly autonomous region, to help it fund those additional services. italy is a unitary state based on mutual fiscal solidarity among regions, bressa said. in order to get more money from the central state, lombardy should demonstrate that the services offered are better if compared to those provided by the state itself. if 27 billion euros were to be used to fund something different from services, italy could not survive of course. even if there is a large yes vote in sunday s referendums, experts do not expect quick or dramatic change. lombardy would consider it a victory if it managed to pick up a few more responsibilities and around 12 billion euros in additional funds, said the university of turin s ricolfi. politically, though, it could inflame tensions between the rich north and poor south, and weaken the seams of a nation that was a collection of small regional states, speaking a variety of dialects, until unification in the 19th century. once you open up the issue of what the northern regions pay, then i expect a backlash in southern italy, said giovanni orsina, history professor at rome s luissguido carli university. 1 0.8504 euros", "tokens": ["reuters", "s", "t", "milan", "of", "said", "independence", "had", "venice", "won", "roberto", "pays",

{"sample_id": 28, "text": "deadly somalia blast reveals flaws in intelligence efforts. nairobimogadishu reuters the size and methods of the latest truck bombing in mogadishu show how international and somali government efforts to stop the killings are failing, partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed, security sources say. more than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the horn of africa nation. the islamist insurgency al shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely. somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said hussein moalim mohamud sheikh ali, a former national security adviser to the president. the national security architecture is in tatters, he told reuters. the shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state. the increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in somalia ahead of the withdrawal of african union peacekeepers at the end of the year. they also are a concern for other countries in the region where al shabaab is active, such as kenya and uganda. in 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by nairobibased thinktank sahan research. initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say. competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices ieds, four western and one somali security source told reuters. a letter from somalia s minister of internal security addressed to the united states, britain and the united nations in may complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence. multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counterterrorism efforts, said the letter, seen by reuters. the pressure is building on president mohamed abdullahi mohamed, who must ensure somalia s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000strong au force leaves. his government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint u.s.somali raid on bariire in august that residents say killed 10 civilians. political disagreements threaten cooperation between somalia s federal and regional forces. last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. the interior ministry spokesman resigned this week. somali police did not respond to requests for comment. highgrade explosives obtaining highgrade military explosives the material that makes a bomb explode involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else. making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the sahan report and an upcoming report from a u.n. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on somalia. according to the u.n. report which is due to be published next month, the u.s. terrorist explosive device analytical center, which is funded by the federal bureau of investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicleborne bomb incidents since 2016. the potential use of hme homemade explosive by al shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious allowing the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its ieds, said the report. al shabaab, which wants to overthrow somalia s u.n.backed government and impose strict islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for saturday s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed. mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said. a former top al shabaab commander, mukhtar robow abu mansur, condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. robow defected to the government in august after the u.s. government removed a 5 million bounty for his capture. two mogadishubased security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to reuters. they said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit mogadishu international airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a european

{"sample_id": 31, "text": "in blustery call, trump pressured mexico on border wall payment. washington reuters president donald trump pressured the mexican president to stop voicing opposition in public to his plan to have mexico pay for a border wall, according to transcripts of phone calls published on thursday that gave an insight into trumps attempts to influence foreign leaders in his first days in office. the washington post published texts of sometimes fraught calls with mexicos enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull just days after the republican took office on jan. 20. the substance of the calls has previously been reported but the lengthy transcripts reveal trump, whose first elected office is the presidency, trying to use a mixture of bluster, tough talk and charm as he fully enters the world of diplomacy. trump argued with turnbull over refugees in an acrimonious call on jan. 28 which the new u.s. president told his counterpart was unpleasant. in a jan. 27 call, trump pressed pena nieto to avoid saying in public that mexico would not fund the planned border wall. but he complimented the mexican leaders beautiful words and said he hoped mexico would change its constitution to allow pena nieto to extend his stay in office. the proposed wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the united states, is a bone of contention between mexico and washington. pena nieto has repeatedly rejected trumps promise that mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction. trump told the mexican leader in the call that if you are going to say that mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then i do not want to meet with you guys anymore because i cannot live with that, according to the transcript. you cannot say that to the press, trump said. pena nieto had earlier scrapped a plan to hold talks with trump in the united states due to tensions over the wall and trade. the two men have since met, holding talks at a summit of the group of 20 nations in germany last month. the white house has said the u.s. government will pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work. both the white house and mexicos foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on thursday about the release of the call transcripts. it was the latest in a series of leaks from inside trumps administration which have angered the president. the republican won some sympathy over leaks from a political opponent on thursday. i am alarmed at leaks of conversations between two heads of state, democratic u.s. senator brian schatz wrote on twitter. it doesnt matter what i think of this president, this is terrible. in the conversation with pena nieto, trump said both leaders were in a little bit of a political bind due to trumps campaign pledge to build the wall and have mexico foot the bill. i have to have mexico pay for the wall i have to. i have been talking about it for a twoyear period, trump said. he suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked. they are going to say, who is going to pay for the wall, mr. president? to both of us, and we should both say, we will work it out, trump said. it will work out in the formula somehow. as opposed to you saying, we will not pay and me saying, we will not pay, the u.s. president said. pena nieto said he understood trumps position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking a creative way to jump over this obstacle. toward the end of their conversation, trump responded effusively to a comment by pena nieto about the mexican leaders wish for a constructive relationship with the united states. your words are so beautiful. those are beautiful words and i do not think i can speak that beautifully, okay? trump said. i want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in mexico so that you can run again for another six years, he said. by law, mexican presidents can only serve one sixyear term. drug infestedden in comments likely to upset voters in new hampshire an important early voting state in the u.s. presidential election primaries trump described the state as a druginfested den. i won new hampshire because new hampshire is a druginfested den, he said, complaining that drugs from mexico are damaging the united states. while trump won the republican primary there, he narrowly lost the state to democratic rival hillary clinton in the general election. new hampshire officials from both parties lashed out at trump, with several saying his push to repeal the obamacare healthcare law would worsen the nations opioid crisis. speaking to australias turnbull, trump became irritated that the united states was expected to honor an agreement made by his democratic predecessor, barack obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in australian processing centers on remote pacific islands. trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the united states, according to the transcript. this is going to kill me. i am the worlds greatest person that does not want to let people into the country, trump said. seeking to win trumps support, turnbull on friday said washington could honor the deal while taking as few as 100 refugees from the two offshore centers, should the rest fail to satisfy its vetting. it has always been subject to american vetting procedures, turnbull told reporters in western australia state. those procedures from the department of homeland security are ongoing. the dialogue was a frank conversation between adults, he added. trump told turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day, after speaking to russian president vladimir putin and others. i have had it. i have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day, trump said. putin was a pleasant call. this is ridiculous.", "tokens": ["reuters", "washington", "mexico", "your", "20", "new", "primary", "leaders", "little", "the", "germany", "constitution", "going", "asked", "can"], "importances": [0.32900522257427, 0.1254515696907469, 0.11287509357719164, 0.09319841677878245, 0.08482768808363761, 0.07151499028881239, 0.024200904844765548, -0.02232080625260179, -0.018991819523796746, -0.015923970275422368, 0.008868294031190058, -0.007038779878315454, 0.0060958756624947315, -0.002789713473856385, 0.0008014265255700971], "pred_label": 1, "true_label": 1, "dataset": "kaggle", "method": "lime"}

{"sample_id": 38, "text": "senators push wells fargo ceo on pay clawbacks after bogus accounts. reuters u.s. senate lawmakers excoriated wells fargo cos chief on tuesday for his oversight of the bank as it opened 2 million bogus customer accounts, potentially laying the groundwork for new rules and reviving questions of whether banks are too big to fail. chief executive officer john stumpf told the senate banking committee on tuesday that customers who had bogus accounts opened in their name will be made whole and compensated for any damage to their credit rating, but some democratic senators called for his resignation. under fire, stumpf said he has told his managers to do whatever it takes to make customers whole, refunding fees or compensating them for damage to their credit ratings. but he stood behind the former executive who ran the unit that oversaw many of the practices, and at times downplayed the scope of the affair. in answer to a question, he declined to commit to setting aside mandatory arbitration agreements that prohibit clients from suing wells fargo. the consumer finance protection bureau has proposed a ban on such clauses that prohibit classaction lawsuits. earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay 190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers knowledge. about 5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts. the revelations are a severe hit to wells fargos reputation. during the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted itself as conservative, in contrast to its rivals. besides potential criminal charges against the company and its executives, wells fargo may face pressure from shareholders to change its practices on executive pay and governance. the scandal also renewed debate over whether u.s. banks are too big to fail and need closer government oversight to prevent a massive collapse. lawmakers could use the fraud settlement as a springboard for new rules on executive pay, including clawbacks of compensation, and limits on forced arbitration. wells fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to a nowretired executive at the center of the scandal, carrie tolstedt. democratic senators jeff merkley of oregon and elizabeth warren of massachusetts called for stumpf to resign, with warren saying stumpf should give back his salary and be criminally investigated. you should resign. you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated, warren said. the banks board of directors is examining what action it should take against company executives, stumpf told the committee. i accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices, stumpf said, adding later, i apologize to all of the american people and our customers, and i will make it right. lawmakers said the phony bank accounts might have hurt customer credit ratings, increased the cost of a mortgage or car loan. new credit card applications and consumer borrowing trends can weight on an individuals credit. wells fargo has acknowledged bank employees inappropriately opened the customer accounts and that about 5,300 employees were fired over five years. former bank employees say they were under intense pressure to add accounts for each customer. abuses were found as early as 2011, stumpf said, but bank executives only realized the scale of the problem early last year. at that time, stumpf said, managers came to recognize how a pattern of creating phony accounts could be used to boost unwarranted fees. it never dawned on us that there could be a cycle, the ceo said. it just sort of begs the issue of where was management, said senator sherrod brown of ohio, the senior democrat on the panel. brown said employees were caught forging signatures, and stealing identities, social security numbers, and customers hardearned cash, so as to hang on to their lowpaying jobs and make money for the highpaying executives at wells fargo. thomas curry, the comptroller of the currency, said the agency is considering action against individual wells fargo executives who may have violated laws or regulations. the u.s. attorneys offices in manhattan and in san francisco are investigating wells fargo, a person familiar with the matter said last week. while democratic lawmakers were the most outspoken in their attacks, republicans also grilled stumpf. louisiana senator david vitter pressed the ceo on how customer fraud could persist for years and thousands of employees could be fired before the head of the bank got involved. why isnt this crystal clear proof that an entity as big as wells is not only too big to fail but its too big to manage and too big to regulate? vitter asked. stumpf said the widespread abuse was a problem of focus and not of size. stumpf appeared before the congressional panel with a bandaged right hand. he suffered an injury playing with his grandchildren, according to the bank. wells fargo shares rose 2 percent to 46.94.", "tokens": ["reuters", "accounts", "of", "s", "to", "lender", "carrie", "action", "board", "john", "under", "as", "questions", "excoriated", "later"], "importances": [0.7107462211480595, 0.061815274442563226, 0.051255736858022864, 0.05080253295030312, 0.05001978183391123, 0.046877020267169396, 0.039448692629049036, -0.03642108167029733, 0.03606502486871988, 0.034485903810802174, 0.03254927216818281, 0.02932119570865197, -0.02074119370362262, -0.019702071470925828, -0.017652575486735687], "pred_label": 1, "true_label": 1, "dataset": "kaggle", "method": "lime"}

{"sample_id": 45, "text": "vocal, powerful critic of wall street rules leaving congress. washington reuters representative jeb hensarling, the republican chairman of the u.s. house of representatives financial services committee, announced on tuesday that he would retire from congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of congresss leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. hensarling, 60, of texas, said in a statement that he would not seek reelection, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. he has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. today i am announcing that i will not seek reelection to the u.s. congress in 2018, hensarling said in a statement. although service in congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, i never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and i have already stayed far longer than i had originally planned. hensarling, first elected to congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 doddfrank financial reform law. the overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 20072009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. that bill, the financial choice act, is not expected to become law after passing the house, due to insufficient support in the senate. but his work was hailed by gop colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. jeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal doddfrank and deliver a freer market that gives every american the opportunity to achieve the american dream, said house majority leader kevin mccarthy in a statement. banking lobby groups, including the financial services roundtable and american bankers association, said hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. he has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. but those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put americans at risk of a similar meltdown. hensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. we hope the revolving door doesnt hit him too hard on the way out, said karl frisch, executive director of allied progress. while some gop lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill reelection battles, hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in texas where he remains highly popular. in 2016, he faced no republican rivals in the partys primary and took 80.6 percent of the districts vote in the general election. even though the district consistently votes republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the house in 2018. lawyer dan wood, has already entered the race to be the partys nominee for the seat. unlike some exiting republicans, hensarling never publicly feuded with president donald trump. in fact, trump had considered hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. his exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. representative patrick mchenry is the vice chair of the committee, but representatives blaine luetkemeyer, bill huizenga, and sean duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. one lobbyist said luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as mchenry is seen as a rising star in house leadership. luetkemeyer is seriously considering running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. hensarlings next move is unclear. some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the heritage foundation. alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. cowen and co analyst jaret seiberg said in a client note that hensarling could be the top contender to take over the federal housing finance agency, which regulates fannie mae and freddie mac. the current fhfa director, mel watt, is an appointee of former president barack obama, serving out a term that expires in january of 2019.", "tokens": ["reuters", "u", "washington", "deeply", "house", "steadfast", "districts", "in", "ambitious", "some", "freer",

{"sample_id": 58, "text": "trump says hes likely to sign healthcare order this week. washington reuters president donald trump said on tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow americans to buy strippeddown health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the obamacare law that trump opposes. unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a congress led by his own party, trump indicated he would take unilateral action. he offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain great, competitive healthcare costing the united states nothing. the expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements. these include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment. it would also expand the amount of time people can use shortterm medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. people could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law. ill also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare, trump told reporters in the oval office. with congress the way it is, i decided to take it upon myself, trump added, saying the plan is largely worked out. white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will make his announcement by the end of friday. trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. the association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. it is unclear when these plans would become available. it is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins nov. 1. experts questioned trumps authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare. the plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 affordable care act, dubbed obamacare. that could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the trump administration. experts said trumps plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the laws protection that people with preexisting medical conditions cannot be charged more. theres a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets, said craig garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management, referring to the trump administration. it unwinds the ability of people with preexisting conditions to get insurance under the aca, garthwaite said. republicans have failed to make good on their sevenyear promise to repeal and replace obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of trumps democratic predecessor barack obama. gutting obamacare was a top trump campaign promise. trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it implode, has undermined obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. last week, the u.s. department of health and human services issued a rule that will let businesses and nonprofit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the laws mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no copayment. trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under obamacare. the payments are estimated to be about 7 billion this year and help lower outofpocket medical costs for lowincome consumers. insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums. his administration has slashed the obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law.", "tokens": ["reuters", "washington",

{"sample_id": 74, "text": "trump threat to renegotiate u.n. climate deal causes dismay abroad. oslowashington reuters donald trumps vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected u.s. president caused dismay abroad on wednesday, with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels. u.s. insistence on renegotiation could unravel a 195nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in paris in december after fraught talks between nations as different as china, the united states, small island states and opec members. the paris agreement is as much in the united states interests as any other country, said tony de brum, ambassador for climate change of the marshall islands who, as his countrys foreign minister, helped broker the u.n. deal. seeking to unravel it would not only threaten the u.s. economy, damage its environment, and weaken its security, but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity, he said. trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee, told reuters on tuesday he was not a big fan of the climate accord. he said china and other countries would not stick to the onesided deal, which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming. i will be looking at that very, very seriously, and at a minimum i will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. and at a maximum i may do something else, he said. trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by china to hurt the competitiveness of u.s. business. government officials meeting in bonn, germany, from may 1626 to find ways to implement the deal, raised concerns about trumps comments but doubted he would take serious action. thats because the deal imposes no real constraints on the united states it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change. president barack obama has promised to cut emissions by 2025, but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply, meaning little incentive to challenge the u.n. deal. many officials also say it is in u.s. interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions, partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution, a big cause of disease. even many nations traditionally sceptical that manmade greenhouse emissions stoke climate change, like opec countries, have gone along with the paris agreement. george david banks, a senior climate change adviser to president george w. bush and a trump supporter, said trump could try to force countries like china to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement. thats wishful thinking, according to john coequyt, director of green group the sierra clubs international climate campaigns. you cant get more than 190 countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing, he said. the paris agreement will formally enter into force when 55 nations representing at least 55 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. china and the united states, representing 38 percent, say they will join this year. if the deal enters into force before the next u.s. president takes office next year, it will in theory be harder to pull out. article 28 says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force the length of a u.s. presidential term. trumps easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected, legal experts say. trump could ignore the targets set by obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming. the paris agreements flexible approach, allowing all to set their own goals, is radically different from the u.n.s 1997 kyoto protocol, which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until 2012. the united states did not take part in kyoto president george w. bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that, he said, unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by china and india. former french foreign minister laurent fabius, who helped broker the paris deal, said this month that the u.s. election was critical to its future. if a climate change denier was to be elected, it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption, he said. but u.s. chief climate envoy jonathan pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the paris agreement whoever wins the white house.", "tokens": ["reuters", "u", "paris", "insistence", "agreement", "wednesday",

{"sample_id": 87, "text": "china defends its right to ready slingshot in south china sea. beijing reuters china defended its right on thursday to put necessary military installations on artificial islands in the south china sea, after a u.s. thinktank said beijing appeared to have deployed weapons such as antiaircraft and antimissile systems. the asia maritime transparency initiative amti at the center for strategic and international studies said its findings, made available first to reuters on wednesday, were based on analysis of satellite images of islands in the strategic trade route, where territory is claimed by several countries. the united states has previously criticized what it called chinas militarization of its maritime outposts, and stressed the need for freedom of navigation by conducting periodic air and naval patrols near them that have angered beijing. chinas defence ministry said in a statement on its website on thursday that the construction it had carried out on islands and reefs in the disputed spratlys chain was mainly for civilian use. as for necessary military installations, they are mainly for defence and selfprotection and are legitimate and lawful, it said. if someone makes a show of force at your front door, would you not ready your slingshot? the united states has conducted four freedom of navigation patrols, seen as a challenge to chinas extensive territorial claims in the south china sea, in the past year or so, most recently in october. amti said satellite images of islands china has built in the spratlys showed what appeared to be antiaircraft guns and what were likely to be closein weapons systems ciws to protect against cruise missile strikes. other images showed towers that likely contained targeting radar, it said. beijing regards the islands as its sovereign territory, and has often said it is entitled to limited and necessary defensive installations. amti director greg poling said the thinktank had spent months trying to figure out the purposes of the structures shown in the images. this is the first time that were confident in saying they are antiaircraft and ciws emplacements. we did not know that they had systems this big and this advanced there, he told reuters. this is militarization. the chinese can argue that its only for defensive purposes, but if you are building giant antiaircraft gun and ciws emplacements, it means that you are prepping for a future conflict. chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing in beijing that he did not understand the situation referred to in the amti report. the nansha islands are chinas inherent territory. chinas building of facilities and necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own territory is completely normal, he said, using chinas name for the spratlys. if chinas building of normal facilities and deploying necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own islands is considered militarization, then what is the sailing of fleets into the south china sea? the philippines, one of several countries with competing territorial claims in the south china sea, said it was still verifying the report. but if true it is a big concern for us and the international community who use the south china sea lanes for trade, said defence minister delfin lorenzana. it would mean that the chinese are militarising the area which is not good. lorenzanas comments were made during a visit to singapore with president rodrigo duterte, where he also said the united states had agreed to sell the philippine navy two advanced radar systems to boost its surveillance capability in the south china sea. australia too voiced concerns about chinas actions in the disputed waterway. the building of artificial islands and the possible militarization is creating an environment of tension and mistrust between claimants and other regional states, said foreign minister julie bishop in a statement. we urge claimants to refrain from coercive behavior and unilateral actions designed to change the status quo in disputed areas. u.s. presidentelect donald trump, who takes office on jan. 20, has criticized chinese behavior in the south china sea, while signaling he may adopt a tougher approach to chinas assertive behavior in the region than president barack obama. the state department said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but spokesman john kirby added we consistently call on china as well as other claimants to commit to peacefully managing and resolving disputes, to refrain from further land reclamation and construction of new facilities and the militarization of disputed features.", "tokens": ["beijing", "reuters", "said", "u", "deployed", "minister", "against", "claimants", "state", "are", "you", "comments", "big", "militarization", "presidentelect"], "importances": [0.1428494750206623, 0.1420109030790215, 0.059217655839477766, 0.056378857515780124, 0.04807091418291081, 0.04470148162521026, 0.040354136629123176, 0.038446041130720435, -0.038066815513648496, 0.03522356756915778, -0.03491166122920547, -0.03456910919822259, -0.032766364101345626, 0.024106981502941386, 0.018511285120686536], "pred_label": 1, "true_label": 1, "dataset": "kaggle", "method": "lime"}
{"sample_id": 88, "text": "britain, eu clinch brexit breakthrough with move to trade talks. brussels reuters britain and the european union struck a divorce deal on friday that paves the way for arduous talks on future trade ties, easing immediate pressure on prime minister theresa may and boosting hopes of an orderly brexit. may rushed to brussels before dawn to seal a european commission agreement that sufficient progress had been made to begin talks about trade and a twoyear brexit transition period that will start when britain leaves the eu on march 29, 2019. negotiators in london, brussels and dublin worked through the night before breaking an impasse over the status of the irish border, the last major obstacle to the opening of trade talks which eu leaders are due to bless at a summit on dec. 15. but though the irish prime minister called a british pledge to avoid a destabilising hard border for northern ireland a bulletproof commitment, one senior eu official conceded that wording to appease may s belfast allies was a fudge which had simply put off until later the need to square the circle . while northern ireland would remain aligned with the rules of the eu s single market and customs union under which member state ireland operates, may s government is officially committed to leaving both the single market and customs union. actual negotiations on a trade pact that may take several years to agree may not start for some months. but eu officials said they should be ready to start rapid talks in january to give may the transition period she wants to reassure business that not much will change for a couple of years after brexit. speaking before sunrise at the eu executive s headquarters after a hurried flight on a royal air force plane, may said opening up trade talks would bring certainty for citizens and businesses about britain s future after quitting the eu. the most difficult challenge is still ahead, european council president donald tusk cautioned. we all know that breaking up is hard. but breaking up and building a new relationship is much harder. may, looking weary after just a couple of hours sleep, spoke after commission president jeanclaude juncker announced the breakthrough, first in english and then in german and french. the move to agree trade talks 18 months after the united kingdom s shock vote to exit the eu allayed some fears of a disorderly brexit that could disrupt trade between the world s biggest trading bloc and its sixthlargest national economy. sterling was dented when lastminute objections from belfast forced may to abort a deal on monday while already in brussels, but it climbed to a sixmonth high against the euro eurgbpd3 on friday. it later gave up earlier gains and turned lower on the day against the eu common currency as investors took profits after a sharp rally in recent days. facing 27 other members of the bloc, may largely conceded to the eu on the structure, timetable and substance of the negotiations. moving to talks about trade and a brexit transition was crucial for may s own future after her premiership was thrown into doubt when she lost the ruling conservative party its majority in an unwisely called snap election in june. i very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead, said may, a 61yearold anglican vicar s daughter who herself voted to stay in the eu in the june 2016 referendum but has repeatedly insisted britain will make a success of brexit. a senior british banker said the deal signalled may would stay in power for now and that britain was heading toward a much closer postbrexit relationship with the eu than many had feared. irish prime minister leo varadkar agreed. ...what phase one was always about was narrowing the parameters, and we are now funnelling and directing things into a situation where i believe the united kingdom including northern ireland will remain in alignment with the eu on lots of regulations, he told irish national broadcaster rte on friday evening. heralding pitfalls ahead, however, scotland s leader nicola sturgeon swiftly cited the promise of free trade on the irish border as removing an argument used to dissuade scots from breaking their union with england to rejoin the european union. draft guidelines showed the transition period, which would start on march 30, 2019, could last around two years, as may has requested. during that time, britain will remain part of the eu s customs union and single market but no longer take part in eu institutions or have a vote. it will also still be subject to eu law. probrexit conservative lawmakers rallied around her after the deal. this looked like a signal that the party, which has been split over eu membership for generations, was not preparing to ditch her immediately despite the election fiasco in june that left her government dependent on the support of northern ireland s democratic unionist party dup. british foreign secretary boris johnson, who spearheaded the 2016 brexit campaign, congratulated may, adding that britain would now take back control of its laws, money and borders. supporters of a radical brexit were tougher. brexit campaigner nigel farage struck a jarring note saying it was extraordinary a british premier had conceded so much in the middle of the night, agreeing to all the demands of juncker, tusk and eu negotiator michel barnier. the british prime minister has to fly through the middle of the night to go and meet three unelected people, who condescendingly say now, jolly well done may, you ve met every single one of our demands, thank you very much, we can now move on to the next stage . asked for an example of the eu conceding something to london, which says it will pay 4045 billion euros over many years to meet eu obligations, barnier said brussels dropped a demand that britain bear relocation costs for two eu agencies that are leaving london costs in the hundreds of millions. juncker once put the brexit bill at some 60 billion euros 52.7 billion but barnier said it was not possible to calculate a firm figure as much depended on future developments. jeremy corbyn, the socialist leader of britain s main opposition labour party, said on friday he wanted to see much more information about the divorce deal before he could judge whether it was a breakthrough. corbyn said labour had consistently called for maintaining the benefits of belonging to the eu s customs union and single market during a transitional period as britain leaves the bloc. the transitional period is unspecific and i think she needs to bring some clarity to that, he said on a visit to geneva. the eu had insisted it would only move on to trade talks if there was enough progress on three key issues the money britain must pay to the eu rights for eu citizens in britain and british citizens in the eu and how to avoid a hard border with ireland. i believe we have now made the breakthrough we needed, juncker said. on citizens rights, london and brussels agreed to offer equal treatment on social security, healthcare, employment and education and that britain will enable its judges to ask the european court of justice to weigh in when necessary for eight years after brexit, aiming to create a common body of law. but the crucial breakthrough was on the future of the 310mile 500km ukeu land border on the island of ireland. the northern irish dup had vetoed a draft deal on monday. may stayed up most of the night into friday, grabbing just a couple of hours sleep, as she worked the phones from downing street to secure agreement from dublin, brussels and the dup. they agreed to avoid a hard border which might upset the peace established after decades of protestantcatholic violence, but said the details would be agreed as part of talks about the future relationship, according to a 15page negotiators report. britain agreed that should london and brussels fail to agree a final brexit deal, the united kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union that help protect northsouth cooperation in ireland. in all circumstances, the united kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for northern ireland s businesses to the whole of the united kingdom internal market, it said. the dup gave only a conditional endorsement of the new terms we cautioned the prime minister about proceeding with this agreement in its present form given the issues which still need to be resolved, its leader arlene foster said. nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and how we vote on the final deal will depend on its contents. it remains unclear how britain can fully meet all three key pledges it has made on the border keeping northern irish rules in line with the eu, keeping northern ireland aligned with the uk mainland and allowing the uk to diverge from eu regulations. it s still a fudge, said one senior eu official. they put off squaring the circle till later. but how can they do it? for brussels and dublin, however, the key commitment was the first. the rest is theresa may s problem, the official said. 1 0.8510 euros",

{"sample_id": 95, "text": "austria puts the squeeze on refugees with benefit cuts. vienna reuters ahmed ali, a 34yearold teacher, fled the war in syria two years ago and settled in a quiet austrian town on the hilly border with the czech republic. he was hoping to raise a family there. but voter attitudes towards immigrants have hardened due to concerns about security and the economy after austria took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015. this fueled support for the farright party freedom party and its candidate came close to winning last year s presidential election. immigration is still the dominant political issue ahead of the oct. 15 parliamentary election. in january, lawmakers in lower austria, where ali lived, reduced benefits for new arrivals. they said the benefits system needed protecting from being overstretched by the influx of refugees. ali and his pregnant wife moved again to vienna in july, where their benefits would still be paid in full. most of us fled when the letter came telling us our social benefits would be cut. at first we didn t believe it but then we saw it on our bank balance, said ali, who says his german is not yet good enough to find work. three of austria s nine provinces lower austria, burgenland and upper austria have reduced benefits for new arrivals. foreign minister sebastian kurz, leader of the conservative people s party which is leading in the polls, wants to make similar cuts apply to the whole country. chancellor christian kern, whose social democratic party polls show competing with the freedom party for second place, has resisted the idea but said he could support them in cases where new arrivals turn down job offers. so far, the cuts have primarily impacted migrants like ali who sought asylum in austria when it opened its border in 2015 although some austrians returning home have also been caught. in burgenland the rules apply to all people seeking help who have spent fewer than five years of the six preceding their application for benefits in austria. a statement accompanying the upper austrian bill painted the cuts as a way to tackle the problem of welfare magnetism in the context of refugees. the lower austrian government declined to comment due to a legal challenge against the cuts. in a case brought by a charity, austria s constitutional court is expected to rule next year on whether the cuts by lower austria, decided in late 2016 and implemented since early 2017, are illegal. the 1951 united nations refugee convention says host countries must grant refugees the same treatment with respect to public relief and assistance as their own nationals. a 2011 eu directive sets a similar rule. the u.n. refugee agency unhcr, which has denounced xenophobic debates in austrian politics ahead of the election, has described the cuts as breaches of international and european law but no international cases have been started. a burgenland spokeswoman defended the benefits changes, saying they targeted austrian nationals as well. therefore there is no violation of ... the eu directive and the refugee convention, she said. a spokesman for kurz said legislation to expand the cuts would be passed and phrased in such a way that no doubt for the highest courts will emerge . the three provinces have cut benefits for new arrivals, even after obtaining asylum, to around 570 euros 669 a month, less than half the poverty threshold of 1,200 euros, compared with around 850 euros for an austrian who has never lived abroad. benefits for a household have been capped at 1,500 euros. rather than live off less than what is considered the bare minimum for most austrians, many of those affected have moved, particularly to the capital. ali moved to an apartment with his uncle and aunt in a dilapidated building on the outskirts of the city costing 1,100 euros a month. they don t care how many children you have. and maybe they ll cut again, ali said in his living room with two sofas, a television set and a picture of kurdish leader masoud barzani. he found more affordable apartments but the landlord did not want refugees as tenants. one landlady was concerned social benefits for refugees might be cut in vienna, too. instead of cutting the social safety net, integration and independence should be supported. we fear that language learning, training and the search for work will suffer if those affected don t know how to pay their rent anymore, said the chief the unhcr s austria office, christoph pinter. although the freedom party and kurz s conservatives have been the most vocal about cutting benefits for new arrivals, the three provinces that have put cuts in place are governed by various twoway combinations of all three main political parties. but most of those affected who spoke to reuters fear an election victory for kurz. if kurz wins, it will be a big problem, said 24yearold basel from deraa in syria. he moved from lower austria to vienna in july, leaving behind friends and a job as a hairdresser. he says the cuts paralyze people like him with fear. you stop thinking about the future. for a graphic

{"sample_id": 96, "text": "europe could be next mission for merkels mr fix it. berlin reuters peter altmaier once said he would never rise to the top tier of german politics because of his appearance he is a huge man who seems perpetually dishevelled, with shirt untucked and tie askew. but chancellor angela merkel s chief of staff and standin finance chief could become the most influential minister in her next coalition government, senior officials say. in recent years, merkel has often turned to altmaier, who is known as her allzweckwaffe all purpose weapon, to carry out the most sensitive and complex tasks, from securing majorities for unpopular greek bailouts to coordinating the government s response to the 2015 refugee crisis. since a sept. 24 election, he has also emerged as a bridge builder between the disparate parties in coalition talks. if the talks succeed, some officials believe merkel will try to keep him at the finance ministry so he can tackle what may be the biggest challenge of her fourth term brokering a deal with french president emmanuel macron on a reform of the european union. if merkel made him finance minister for this transition period, then it is a sign that she trusts him to do this job in the future, a senior aide to the chancellor told reuters. henrik enderlein, head of the delors institut in berlin, a think tank, said it would send a very strong signal to france if altmaier continued in the finance ministry post. the liberal free democrats fdp are expected to have first choice of ministry in the new government. but if their leader christian lindner does not claim the finance ministry for himself, altmaier could be in pole position. although the fdp and members of merkel s christian democrats cdu are skeptical about some of macron s proposals notably his idea to create a budget and finance minister for the euro zone some believe altmaier s tone alone would inject new momentum into the relationship between berlin and paris. altmaier, who declined to speak to reuters for this story, has not said publicly whether he is interested in becoming finance minister permanently after meeting french finance minister bruno le maire last week, he said not all proposals from paris would be greeted with unlimited enthusiasm . but he added i never made it a secret that i m an advocate of francogerman cooperation. a jovial 59yearold from the state of saarland on the french border, altmaier stands out among politicians and the officials in merkel s close entourage, dominated by technocrats. the son of a coal miner and a nurse, altmaier was the first prominent german politician to actively embrace twitter. he hosts extravagant dinners at his vast apartment in west berlin, cooking gefilde a saarland specialty of potato dumplings filled with liverwurst and soaked in a baconcream sauce for guests of all political stripes. altmaier speaks fluent english, french and dutch and, unlike his boss, is a master communicator. he also likes to make fun of himself, particularly his weight, which he estimated several years ago at 140 kilos 309 pounds but now describes as a state secret . i may not be the wichtigste most important minister but i am the gewichtigste heaviest, he has joked. after years as merkel s mr fix it , some cdu officials see him as a dark horse candidate to succeed the chancellor one day. as parliamentary whip for the cdu, he won over skeptics about the greek bailouts with homecooked meals and red wine. the thinner the majority, the fatter altmaier gets, bundestag members used to quip. later, as merkel s environment minister, he brought order to her nuclear power phaseout and was appointed her chief of staff in 2013. two years later, she turned to altmaier for help over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees and again this year to write the cdu s election program. in coalition talks between merkel s conservatives, the fdp and greens, altmaier has been a mediator, gently nudging the parties closer together, participants say. like merkel, he is a cdu moderate. after joining the bundestag in 1994, he incurred the wrath of traditionalists by pushing for a reform of strict german citizenship laws and the rehabilitation of world war two deserters. he was part of the pizza connection , a group of young lawmakers from the cdu and greens who met regularly at an italian restaurant in bonn, when the environmentalist party was viewed as a radical, fringe group by many conservatives. before entering german politics, altmaier studied european law and worked at the european commission, later participating in the european convention that led to the eu s lisbon treaty. altmaier is one of a small number of toptier german politicians who has real experience in brussels, said martin selmayr, chief of staff to european commission president jeanclaude juncker, who worked with altmaier in the convention in 2002. he is a committed european and would be a

{"sample_id": 97, "text": "if trump had known about this nixon era law, he wouldnt have run for president. throughout the election, donald trump s tax returns have remained a mystery. he said he d release them if he won, but so far, crickets. it s not a giant leap to imagine that trump has something either incriminating or simply something bad in his taxes. would trump have run for president if he knew a little known law that makes every single presidential tax return go through an automatic audit?the last time we had a known tax evader in office was during the richard nixon administration. his vice president, spiro agnew, was forced to resign in 1973 after pleading guilty to tax evasion. nixon himself was twice audited by the irs. in 1974, he had to pay 465,000 worth of back taxes for a three year period.after that, nixon made all his tax returns public. since then, all but gerald ford, and now trump, have. the irs even passed a law requiring that all sitting presidents and vice presidents are audited every year. the requirement for mandatory audits of the tax returns of the president and vice president dates back to the watergate era in the 1970s, the irs said in a statement to mcclatchy, noting that nonpartisan career employees adopted the requirement. since then, this provision has remained in place during both republican and democratic administrations as well as under irs commissioners appointed by both parties. source mcclatchybefore you get too excited, the law also specifically outlines how the president s and vice president s taxes are handled in special orange folders, in a secure area and with confidentiality. in other words, if trump isn t breaking laws, we still won t be able to see his tax returns.there is a chance that trump could get the law overturned i don t believe there is anything that would prevent the president from instructing that this precautionary measure of the irs audits be rescinded, said norman eisen, who as special counsel to the obama white house during the first term put in place new ethics guidelines. he could theoretically do it. trump could even go beyond having that law overturned. many republicans want to abolish the irs altogether, which is a stupid idea, one which would surely bankrupt the country, but donald trump has shown himself to be thinskinned and completely selfinterested. if he has a beef with the irs, the republican congress could be sympathetic.featured image via drew angerergetty images", "tokens": ["s", "source", "i", "obama", "prevent", "could", "images", "he", "nixon", "have", "who", "forced", "other", "crickets", "returns"], "importances": [2.654400621850074e-05, 1.3505652427481085e-05, 1.1003294353978435e-05, 9.760950947725178e-06, 9.674711252906038e-06, -9.434471593937812e-06, 9.403006564453108e-06, -9.214622081984734e-06, 8.733834705334793e-06, 7.607268852300589e-06, -7.603232669046992e-06, 6.797737462228004e-06, 6.763885907495661e-06, 5.287860567771507e-06, 4.92154984878031e-06], "pred_label": 0, "true_label": 0, "dataset": "kaggle", "method": "lime"}
